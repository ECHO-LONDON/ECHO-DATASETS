The result is impressive ‚Äî ChatGPT distills a dizzyingly complex set of rules into a simple, one-sentence answer. While this might seem like a trivial use of artificial intelligence (AI) apps and services, it‚Äôs actually a very precise encapsulation of both the promise of using LLMs and other AI tools to simplify government information, as well as the perils. Government agencies adopting generative AI tools seems inevitable at this point. Increasingly, agencies are being sold on the power of these new tools to make complex government information and rules easier to find and understand. But there is more than one possible future for how agencies use generative AI to simplify complex government information. What can parking signs tell us about the potential of generative AI and which possible future we are moving toward? Government information is complex As evidenced by that ridiculously tall stack of parking signs, government information is often complex and challenging to understand. The parking rules in the tweet referenced above are not a bad proxy for other kinds of rules that governments create. This information is typically dense, often filled with jargon and acronyms, and can be scattered across multiple locations. Even for those who want to follow the rules, it can be difficult because of the complexity of the information. Simplifying and streamlining complex government rules is often a difficult, time-consuming, and complex undertaking. The better solution to the parking problem at the location in the image above would be to create a single, unified sign with clear rules. But that can be hard. Parking rules, like other rules that government agencies create, are modified over long periods. A single parking location may be subject to multiple jurisdictions ‚Äî county, city, transportation district, and school district ‚Äî each with different rules. The cost of coordinating information from these different jurisdictions and simplifying it is more expensive than simply making the signpost higher, and adding a new sign when the rules change. And the cheaper option typically wins out. In this way, parking rules are not so different from the rules that govern taxes or government benefit programs. These rule sets are developed over long periods and are subject to the jurisdiction of multiple government agencies and different levels of government. Efforts are underway to streamline the rules for these programs and make them easier for people to understand and follow , but time and effort are the critical ingredients. The equivalent of making the signpost higher and adding another sign is still the norm. The promise of AI and LLMs Over the past year alone, every single level of government from the smallest town office to the largest federal agency has been inundated with information (and product offerings) that leverage the power of generative AI and LLMs. ChatGPT, OpenAI‚Äôs LLM-powered chatbot service that launched in late 2022 and fostered popular interest in LLMs, is reported to be the most rapidly adopted consumer technology in history . These tools are remarkably good at distilling complex information into easy-to-understand bits of content. They are not perfect, and there are many potential risks of using LLMs that have been well documented. Still, their ability to distill complex information is impressive and is improving at an accelerated rate as more investments and research are funneled into these new tools. Most federal agencies, and many states and cities, are adopting new AI policies to govern how employees use LLM tools. Widespread LLM adoption by government agencies at this point seems like a foregone conclusion. If that‚Äôs right, then it warrants thinking about the possible futures that might arise from this. How might governments use LLMs to change the way they interact with the public, and what are the implications of these potential choices? How governments use LLMs matters Governments may choose to use LLMs as a tool for changing the way that people navigate complex rule sets or information published on agency websites. They might use LLMs to rewrite and reorganize their web content, making it easier for people to understand . They might use these AI tools to assist customer service agents who often deal with people with complex problems or who face challenges to web-based content or mobile applications. Alternatively, and of some concern, governments might opt to forgo reworking their complex rules and information and simply rely on the ubiquity of new generative AI tools to assist people in consuming government information. Remember the parking sign example discussed above ‚Äì even though reworking a huge stack of complex signs into a coherent, succinct set of rules for parking in one location may make the most sense, the easiest and cheapest option typically wins out. It‚Äôs expensive and time-consuming to rework complex rule sets that have been modified and added to over long periods. If history is any guide, the adoption of AI and LLM tools will follow similar patterns as other consumer technologies. They will continue to become more powerful and more ubiquitous. This is important for governments because as people‚Äôs habits and expectations for consuming information and conducting transactions evolve, governments will need to adapt how they interact with the people they serve. The ubiquity of AI and LLMs has implications for how governments design the experience of interacting with those who use government services, just as the ubiquity of the web browser did. But history also tells us that as new consumer technologies become more popular, access to these new tools will not be distributed evenly . People at the higher end of the income distribution, those with more advanced education and digital literacy skills, and those in closer proximity to the infrastructure supporting the internet will have greater access to these tools. As governments incorporate AI and LLM-powered tools into the experience of using digital services, they must factor in (and offset) this unequal distribution of access to new tools. With AI and LLMs set to dramatically transform how governments operate in the years ahead, it has never been more important for governments to focus on and improve the experience of using digital services . Understanding the barriers people face today in accessing and using government services is critical. If governments don‚Äôt address these issues today and take steps to improve the experience of using digital services , these disparities will be calcified by the advancement of new AI and LLM tools. The choices that governments make in the coming months and years in adopting these new technologies will determine which future we will get. While there is enormous promise in using these tools to streamline complex government information, there is also tremendous peril. https://civic.io/2024/02/27/parking-signs-and-possible-futures-for-llms-in-government/ #AI #artificialIntelligence #ChatGPT #llm #technology"

""The Bicentennial Man"" was my favorite i think, followed by ""The Tercentenary Incident"" and maybe a few of the Susan Calvin stories. obviously he got a lot of things wrong‚Äîwe're still quite far humanoid robots who do our chores for us. but one thing that rings accurate in the 2020s is a story called ""The Evitable Conflict"", where earth's governments supply supercomputers with loads of data which subsequently spit out advice on how to proceed. the supercomputers start behaving strangely, and the protagonist, looking for answers, realizes that no one really understands how they work. every iteration, new engineers build on previous models, feeding more and more data into them, until they become orders of complexity greater than anyone could control. a few years ago, a paper on LLM transformers concluded ""We offer no explanation as to why these architectures seem to work; we attribute their success, as all else, to divine benevolence."" generative AI is becoming widely used, yet remains poorly understood. maybe we should be at least a little worried about that. # literature # scifi # technology # ai"

science,"Paul Abela says: ""We‚Äôre going to pay the price for turning the world into a giant farm."" _______________________________ The idea that Earth is a giant farm may feel like an exaggeration. It‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre being overrun by farm animals. And when we look at images of Earth, we see forests that stretch beyond the horizon. We see awe-inspiring landscapes and angelic beaches. What we don‚Äôt look at are the vast swathes of land that have been converted into farmland. We‚Äôve become so detached from food production that we tend to disregard how food is produced. Today half of all the habitable land on Earth is used for agriculture. While 23% of that land is used to grow crops, 77% is used to produce meat and dairy. Just 3% of the world‚Äôs natural ecosystems, that is, ecosystems uninfluenced by humanity, remain intact. Nature documentaries create an impression that wild animals are abundant. But human interference with ecosystems has led to catastrophic declines in the populations of living species. _______________________________ There's a lot more in the article, including all the damaging pollution associated with meat eating, the destruction of rainforests, the devastating loss of biodiversity, and the advent of a sixth mass extinction. I hope you'll read the whole thing. FULL ARTICLE -- https://www. transformatise.com/2024/03/a-r ecipe-for-disaster/ # Food # Vegan # Science # Environment # Climate # ClimateChange"

science,"So transness exists in many animals and not just humans. It's been observed but I'm going to give you a personal story from my personal life. My exwife was a wildlife rehabilitator. She went to school for it with a specialization in Raptors. That's birds of prey. Not Jurrassic Park. They rehabilitate most birds but some just can't be released. If they can get along with people they become educational ambassadors. IE birds they take out to the public to educate on wildlife conservation and eliminate misconceptions etc etc. Well they have a mated for life Golden Eagle duo. The boy is a little big but not so large that he's in lady eagle territory. In Raptors sexual dimorphism is reversed. It's important for later. He has a wife. Golden Eagles mate for life. They do all the parnter things. Guard eggs. Have s3x. Normal stuff. but zero viable young. No young at all. They think maybe it's just a biproduct of the lady having West Nile virus. Organs move around and change in birds with west nile. It wouldn't be strange if she were infertile. Because these birds are generally traumatized, and sexing of birds is prone to error they just don't do it. He acts like a guy. He is a guy. His lady love loves him very much. Well he dies of old age. It happens. It's sad. So they do an autopsy. Also routine. Also for science. What is it they find in autopsy? Ovaries. No testes. No intersex condition. This eagle is a big masculine boy with ovaries. They had a married heterosexual couple with a trans guy and a cis gal ... if birds could be referred to by such terms. Being trans isn't new. It's not a fad or a woke mind virus. It's not the Democrats or the Greens or the Hippies. It is observed in most animals capable of actually making advanced neural pathways. Some of the smartest creatures on earth are actually birds of prey. So guess where much transness is found? That's right Eagles, Hawks and owls. It's not weird. It's not unnatural. It's part of the normal distribution of thinking species. #Trans #lgbt #raptors #science #wildlife"

food,"Paul Abela says: ""We‚Äôre going to pay the price for turning the world into a giant farm."" _______________________________ The idea that Earth is a giant farm may feel like an exaggeration. It‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre being overrun by farm animals. And when we look at images of Earth, we see forests that stretch beyond the horizon. We see awe-inspiring landscapes and angelic beaches. What we don‚Äôt look at are the vast swathes of land that have been converted into farmland. We‚Äôve become so detached from food production that we tend to disregard how food is produced. Today half of all the habitable land on Earth is used for agriculture. While 23% of that land is used to grow crops, 77% is used to produce meat and dairy. Just 3% of the world‚Äôs natural ecosystems, that is, ecosystems uninfluenced by humanity, remain intact. Nature documentaries create an impression that wild animals are abundant. But human interference with ecosystems has led to catastrophic declines in the populations of living species. _______________________________ There's a lot more in the article, including all the damaging pollution associated with meat eating, the destruction of rainforests, the devastating loss of biodiversity, and the advent of a sixth mass extinction. I hope you'll read the whole thing. FULL ARTICLE -- https://www. transformatise.com/2024/03/a-r ecipe-for-disaster/ # Food # Vegan # Science # Environment # Climate # ClimateChange"

food,"Sometimes you think you‚Äòve done everything wrong only to be rewarded with a super fragrant and extremely delicious dish. Such a lucky day! I had been trying to use up a small pack of dried Hokkaido Scallops that had arrived last year with the Fall Kokoro box - but I kept forgetting that they needed to be rehydrated over night. I finally managed to do that. The recipe I had for them was basically a takikomi rice dish (rice cooked with all the seasonings and ingredients) so I had the idea to use up my Okinawan sauce leftovers from my rafute the other day, together with the soaking water from the scallops (as per the recipe), not really thinking that through. Once it was all in the saucepan (with chopped shiitake, kohlrabi, ginger and spring onion), it occurred to me that I probably just murdered the delicate taste of the scallops. ü•¥ Alas, it was too late, I had to go with the flow. What can I say, the longer the rice steamed away, the better it smelled in the kitchen. And the taste was just as delicious, somehow this was a marriage made in heaven and my family agreed. The rice is topped with marinated silken tofu. I had frozen it a couple of times as that changes the structure and had it marinate away over night in a mix of gochujang, soy sauce, and mirin. It was still quite delicate but mostly held up to my clumsy efforts of turning it in the frying pan. And it tasted really nice too. This was also appreciated by my not so tofu loving co-eaters; they really have been good sports over the last years, trying the many tofu variations I‚Äôve served them. There was also a Napa cabbage salad but somehow it did not make it on a photo. #Mastonom #HomeCooking #Cooking #MainMeal #MyDinner #JapaneseFood #FusionKitchen #Food #Flexitarian #LactoseIntolerant #LactoseFree #SylkewebFood #SylkewebFood202403 #Sylkeweb202403 @foodiverse@a.gup.pe"

movies,"That's it. I've just finished watching Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2. Of course, it's not a full story, but the conclusion of everything else, but I must say that I truly enjoyed it from beginning to end. It is a great conclusion indeed. (just one thing: What was the point of the ""deathly hallows"" themselves? I thought the three objects were supposed to be put together or something) I guess that's it then. I have finally watched/rewatched all of Harry Potter. I'm surprised at how much I liked it this time. I guess the fact that I'm 20 years older and a dad plays a part. Probably. I'm still not too crazy about episodes 4 and 5 - they remain the weakest episodes - but because they were a rewatch they were less confusing and made a little more sense this time. One and two are still kids' movies, but they're good kids' movies. Three is still the only real good movie that stands on its own (a full story, you don't need to have read the book to get it, the characters are all well used and well, Alfonso Cuaron.) I liked six on rewatch and I can't remember why I disliked it so much the first time I saw it (to the point that I had never watched 7 and 8 until this weekend) Seven and eight are pretty good, but they're a final act / conclusion, not a full story. So yeah, Harry Potter fans rejoice, I'm (almost) one of yours. Oh and spoiler alert: if the whole family decided to watch all of Harry Potter right now, it's because we're going to Universal Studios (in Osaka) in 10 days, so we wanted to know the whole thing before. ;-) #HarryPotter #movies #UniversalStudios"

Cooper does a great job of embodying Lenny but I was more impressed with Carey Mulligan's portrayal of his wife, Felicia Montealgre. I've so far seen 6 of the 10 movies nominated for the # Oscar for # BestPicture this year and, of those that I've seen, I think Mulligan deserves the nod for # BestActress although my guess is that Lily Gladstone in ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" will take that award over Emma Stone in ""Poor Things"", who both won a # Grammy for Best Actress in different categories -- drama/comedy. As for # BestActor , Cooper's performance certainly deserves a nod as does Paul Giamatti in ""The Holdovers"" but Cillian Murphy will probably take it for his role in # Oppenheimer , which will also probably take the awards for # BestPicture & # BestDirector as he/it did @ the Grammys.

movies,"I've watched ""Aguirre, wrath of God"", by Werner Herzog. A very personal view of the story of the mad search of El Dorado. There're incredibly beautiful landscapes (it was filmed in the jungle), and the movie really transmits a powerful experience. But there's something unclassifiable in it, too. I don't know how to describe it. The narrative seems... weird. It's very serious and dramatic, but at the same time there's a moment when one character is pierced by a spear, and before dying he comments ""long spears are on fashion lately""... So yes, a movie as unclassifiable as its director. By the way, the electronic soundtrack, by Popol Vuh (name of the Mayan book of myths) is *absolutely amazing.* # movies # cinemastodon"

It's about the mundane life of a kind & apparently erudite janitor who services public toilets in Tokyo. He's not a hermit & does have some social contact -- some pretty odd -- but prefers to live life undisturbed alone tending to the toilets, reading, going to his favorite bookstore & pub, listening to 60's rock on cassettes, going to a public bath house & washing his clothes at a laundromat There's hardly any dialog in the film & one is left to wonder what his earlier life was like, of which we get only small glimpse of thru some interaction w/a niece who unexpectedly drops in on him & his sister who comes to collect her. There are actually some parallels between the janitor's life & mine but I don't think my life is any more interesting than how his is depicted in the film which took great patience on my part to watch until the end, which was ambiguous to say the least. ü§∑"

books,"A Scatter of Light (Malinda Lo) ‚Äì After Aria‚Äôs graduation is disrupted by nonconsensual nudes of her being shared around school, she is blamed and sent to stay with her grandmother in California for a while. But this exile leads her to her grandmother‚Äôs gardener, Steph, who introduces her to the local queer community against the backdrop of the legalisation of gay marriage. Embracing the community, Aria begins to understand her own queerness as she falls for Steph. This is also a partial continuation to Last Night at the Telegraph Club, being set 60 years after and giving a glimpse of what became of Lily and Kath after the 50s. In some ways the two novels offer a contrast on the changes in the community and issues faced across 60 years. This is a beautiful story of queer awakening and fraught, bittersweet relationships. Those early, first love emotions in Aria feel very visceral and relatable. I would have liked a little more of the community, and Steph‚Äôs relationship to gender, but the focus is on Aria‚Äôs journey of love and loss at this key moment of change in her life as all her connections are up in the air while she discovers herself. # Bookstodon # Books # QueerBooks # Queer # LGBTQ # SapphicBooks # Romance"

I knew I was reading the right writer when I encountered the moment in which a thug says to a banker, ""You sleep late, Mr. Partridge. We been waiting a long time.""  The banker's reply? ""Sorry to inconvenience you."" I think the best crime novels are the ones that treat the criminal pastime as a job.

books,"WAYNE'S 2024 BOOKS: BOOK 10 The Bezzle by Cory Doctorow So, if you've read my other book reviews this year, you'll be familiar with the name Cory Doctorow ( @ pluralistic ). If not, become familiar! His work (published in books, delivered by RSS feed or Xitter, or appearing on various websites) is always entertaining and informative. The infotaining nature of his writing is clearly evident in his latest book: The Bezzle. I backed the Kickstarter that successfully funded an audiobook version, although audiobooks aren't my thing and I read it in eBook form on my Pixel 6a. It's the second Martin Hench book, a period piece starting in the dotcom boom era, years before the first Hench book, Red Team Blues. Here we see a less established Martin (sans tour bus) stepping unwittingly into the attention of a sleazy robber baron. Events spiral wildly away from a burger-supply Ponzi scheme (no, really) as the book progresses. The book structure is a little odd; it felt like the pelt of two-and-a-half Last Week Tonight With John Oliver episodes stitched onto the bones of a modern-day Grisham novel. Here the blend of entertaining and informative comes to bear; you know you're being educated as you read, but it's enjoyable, so it doesn't feel like a lecture. There's lessons about MLM investment traps, the hideous state of the California prison-for-profit system, unfair music royalty practises, and more. The Bezzle was a quick and excellent read, and I'll be delving more into Doctorow's back catalogue as the year progesses, thanks to a tasty Humble Bundle deal that's still active as I write. # books # books2024 # corydoctorow # thebezzle # humblebundle # reviews # bookreview"

books,"JFR Gilded Ghost by Kyle Kirrin read by Travis Baldree. This is the third book in the Ripple System series Imagine the next big MMORPG, one with full immersive VR play. There are cycles and seasons, but the big players have, in a matter of weeks, begun triggering world-altering events, and the main character, Ned, is the most hated player in the entire world. Ned's chosen city is about to come under siege by a guild who has razed every place they've targeted, the most popular player and online streamer and his literal cult is gunning for him, and Ned has to bet literally everything he owns and has built in the game to save his city from impending doom. I love Travis' narration. The interactions between Ned and his all-knowing axe, Frank are hilarious. It's an RPG, and there's a lot of reading out of stats, which might be a downside for some.

books,"Which is in fact because I have just finished # AliSmith 's 'Spring'. It is a beautiful novel. Part 1 is particularly brilliant. I'm not sure about its flirtation with magical realism in part 2. We need a writer who can find hope without recourse to magic. On the other hand, it is more mythological realism than magical. We can believe in myth making and story telling. What is real is not the mundane, but the eternal or, better, the eternal in the mundane. Smith is on the side of the angels because she believes in art, in myth in story telling. Spring, with its promise of life, is contrasted with winter which is dark and unenchanted. It is also art and the mundane. Smith is with Chaucer not Elliott. So am I. What I particularly like is the motif that none of this is about you. It serves to cut the privileged down to size, but the moral extends. The story isn't Florence's or the Machines. It is a shared world and 'world' here is truely all that is, was, will be or even could have been the case. # Books , # Fiction , # Migration , # Refugees @ bookstodon"

books,"i‚Äôve been reading miyazaki‚Äôs Starting Point, and it is replete with thinking about what human beings are, and what cartoons can offer them. i knew he was an exceptional animator, but never realized how much effort he put into the psychological foundations of his stories. ‚ÄúI feel that viewers should feel liberated after watching cartoon films, and that the characters should also ultimately be liberated. So I like the idea that the Conan characters actually became more innocent at the end. What really makes me mad about most TV anime, to the extent that I have watched it, is that the shows don't have any sort of purifying or cathartic effect at all. I really can't stand them. I think they don't have any respect for real humanity. The only way they can imagine humans changing is by assuming that people want to change. It's too terrifying for the creators to deal with characters that seem incapable of changing even as they are changing.‚Äù (p. 304) When I think back on his films, I am struck at how many of them end on a non-neurotic note. There is no overcoming the evil bad person. The protagonist doesn‚Äôt get what s/he wants. There is just an uneasy resolution to problems - that were ultimately because of ego, not because of evil. I wish there were more writers like this. # manga # anime # books # bookstodon"
