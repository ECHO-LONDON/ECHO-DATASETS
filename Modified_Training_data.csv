politics,What non-political opinion gives away someone's politics? 
politics,"r/politics is f****** trash  

I swear to god that sub is so toxic. They claim to be 'non-biased' and 'on the fence', While being the most biased people ever. Most popular posts consist of a misleading title, a dumb article, and the most biohazardous comment section ever. People on Reddit literally cannot hold a civil debate without screeching at each other. I also seemed to notice that they love downvoting other opinions to oblivion and even censoring them. It's the most 'orange man bad' sub I've ever seen. It's literally worse than actually dedicated subs. I know this will be downvoted to hell, but it's my opinion, so please respect it. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry if the formatting is off, English isn't my first language.

Update: holy shit my inbox‚Äôs Asshole is ripped. I just wanted to say that I‚Äôm not trying to take sides here. Both parties are guilty of being toxic. Also, I‚Äôm not even a trumpie. I should have written this better so it‚Äôs not misleading."
politics,"Politics in pods I am only on ep 3 but I had to chuckle to myself when Jeramey asked Sarah Ann where she stood on politics. After last season with JP, the topic of couples discussing politics came up a lot in this sub, and it was noted how it‚Äôs never actually shown on the episodes, but of course, we could assume those things were discussed before marriage. I just thought it was funny it was shown this season. We see you lurking, LIB producers üëÄ üëãüèº"
politics,"CMV: R/Politics Should Be Renamed  The default political sub, [r/politics](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/), should be renamed to something to demonstrate the political bias of the sub. It is not a sub for politics, it is a sub for one side of politics. There is not legitimate political discourse because the subreddit is significantly biased, as are the moderators, and they moderate based on said bias. I have no problem with political subs existing with a specific bias. I just take issue that the sub advertised as the subreddit of default politics does not allow discussion of broad politics-only discussion of broad politics from one side."
politics,"How do honest people navigate office politics? After 2.5 years of this crap, I'm finally on the verge of being fired/laid off or whatever the next step is before that. I can tell it from how my manager has been treating me the past few months or so (I have not had any 1-on-1's with him for several months now AND hes been excluding me from trainings that all other team members who've been with the company under 2 years are being explicitly mentioned to be invited to). The team leader directly leading me on my immediate team hardly assigns me work anymore and minimizes his interactions with me specifically just to receive updates. Outside of my team, other coworkers don't really interact with me. I'm not really invited to meetings outside of team meetings. With the other engineers who are in the same YOE as I am, they're typically very passive aggressive towards me, saying stuff like ""wow, see &lt;other coworker's name&gt;, I told you that &lt;my name&gt; was doing important work. Wow, very cool!"" and the other coworker would interject with another snide comment and they're using a sarcastic tone of voice. I can recall MANY instances in our internal team meetings where my manager or another manager or even my team lead is saying ""hey, lets not be open about certain details/issues when we have our meetings with other people from departments"". And I'm someone who sort of let it slide.

When I recall the internship I did before this job, it was even more toxic. Coworkers who weren't afraid to show me that they hated me, would immediately act nice and helpful when management was around and observing. I could recall that I was used for other people's benefit, whether that was my former manager trying to manipulate one of my coworkers or a coworker trying to look like he was being helpful to me when he offered his contact information during my exit out of my internship. Theres so many toxic people in the professional world.

I hate not being honest especially around the issues at work. Its really tiring. When I reflect on how my dad, who is a retired mechanic, transitioned from working under other people in their auto shops to renting out his own autoshop and working as an independent mechanic, it kind of makes sense. My dad is a really honest guy who genuinely likes helping other people. But, the fucking work industry is full of snakes who bully/sabotage other people to get ahead. Really, theres no place for people like me here. I am at my most peaceful when I'm alone."
politics,"What is the best/biggest office politics lesson you have learned in life? I learnt to always get things in writing to be on the safer side, and never trust your line manager with your issues as they might use them against you."
politics,"What is/what are some examples of office politics/drama? I never understood this.  I have always never intimated any drama/negative talk about employees at work and played neutral at jobs/was positive to everyone.  
I would like to hear about some real life stories and examples that seem minor, but happen frequently.  I feel naive to this world at 28f having never really experiencing it and have had many different jobs."

politics,"Was told not to put my political beliefs on my resume. Is this political? I  just failed a job interview yesterday. The guy seemed a bit hostile and basically took all my responses in the worst light. I've seen that before. He already picked who he wanted but was obligated to finish the rest of the interviews. Fine, whatever, I've dealt with that before.

But what gets me is that going over my resume, he gets to the point where I say that I am fully vaccinated against covid-19.  This is for a retail position so I feel it's relevant.  But he gets there and tells me 'Here's a tip, don't announce your political leanings on your resume. No-one with any sense will hire you if you announce it.' (Paraphrasing I don't recall the exact wording)

Again it's a retail job, it seems to me like very relevant information.  But just in case should I remove that from my resume?

EDIT: Thanks for all the answers y'all. I have removed the detail from my resume as the majority reccomends, and I'm glad many understand why I had it on there in the first place.  Got another interview at another place nearby shortly after I posted this and that interview went much better.  Closer place too, still waiting on background check but they basically hired me on the spot.

Thanks for the advice everyone!"

politics,"A Polite Douchebag? So I'm somewhat new to shopping, been doing it about 2 months now and this is the first bad interaction I've had, was just wondering if I was being condescending or rude in any capacity so I can talk to customers better.

Im missing one screenshot of the conversation but I informed the customer they were out of this certain deli cut I'm unfamiliar with so I asked an associate and he reccomended these two items(first picture) as he said he can't get what the customer requested. This was at 11:38am so I could give the customer plenty of time to respond as they preferred text.

This is where in wondering if I was in the wrong, I go through the entire order and never hear back and usually when that happens I just continue on with my order and I did so. At 12:20pm when I was delivering the order she then responded(40min after my text) said the replacement was fine and to contact her. I informed her I already delivered the items and left the store about 15 minutes prior to her text.

She then immediately says she's pissed, asked for a number for management, and then called me polite and a douchebag at the same time after trying to inform her on prefer text/call.

Could I have done anything different? I immediately contacted the support so I could keep the tip and dodge an incoming bad rating which did get removed."

politics,"Politics Politics Politics Roggies is the man, but I haven't been able to listen to a full episode since covid. I've never posted or commented about it and I just thought it's not my cup of tea anymore and he can do what he wants, it's a free podcast after all and he never tells anyone to listen or promotes it which is fair. 

I just wanted to see if anyone shares my sentiment? I do sincerely think that he wasn't a political guy before and he was genuinely curious but as the cast got bigger, I think politics found him and he has since become quite bullish on his ideas. Since the Bernie episode + Covid + moving to Texas + money I think the gravity around him got too dense and I don't blame him. 

I do remember his point on politics before was 'It's a weird system anyway no one can be trusted, and no one person should be running the country it should be a team of people'. I always liked this take because I felt it was a genuine idea and he never tied himself to a side (being true to the comedian who just likes to talk about cool shit). and the point would last 2-5 minutes and then conversation would flow again.  After covid he started complaining of sides and then clearly picked one, I think he has unknowingly become what he is complaining about before. He preaches on episodes, Biden is worked into every episode, and he clearly gets off talking about cancel culture, I think he would be more upset if cancel culture went away because he wouldn't have anything to talk about (he literally just does the same thing but on the other side and repeats his points non-stop). 

Idk, I just wanted to see if I'm the only one because he is clearly still the number 1 podcast in the world and every episode is marked as 'most shared'. Obviously, people change (I've been listening since episode 300) so I don't mind growth, but the episodes have not been fun to listen too... Tell me why I'm wrong though I'd love your opinions. "

That bill is [abs-957](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB957)

In Texas there is a bill that defines allowing your children to receive gender affirming care as child abuse. The governor has directed cps to investigate parents who offer it. That bill is [sb-1646](https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/87R/billtext/pdf/SB01646I.pdf#navpanes=0)

This is insanity and politicians from both sides should be ashamed at playing with people's families like this over their own politics. I personally think it's a horrible idea in most cases to transition children but in a small amount of cases it may be the right thing to do. Only the parents can adequately make this distinction.

Gender politics doesn't give you the right to break up families. It doesn't matter if you're right or left."

machine learning research,"machine learning math Question: How well do OpenAI executives understand the math?   

Sam Altman dropped out of Stanford after 2 years as a CS major, to run Loopt (Wikipedia). Greg Brockman dropped out of Harvard first, and then from MIT, to join Stripe (Wikipedia).   

Mira Murati has a BS in MechEng from a low-ranking university (not in the same level as Stanford or MIT).   
Ilya Sutskever got a PhD under Geoffrey Hinton. He's clearly a scientist.     

Now, Sam and Greg are obviously smart, since they got into top colleges. But, do they understand the math behind AI? Or they just focus on the business side and delegate the math to Ilya?    

For reference, Zuckerberg also became a millionaire after dropping out, but his startup was just a website, a social network, it was not cutting-edge research, as OpenAI seems to be doing. Also, Demis Hassabis does have a PhD.     

I understand this is a math sub, so feel free to make the discussion as mathematical as possible."

machine learning research,"[D] A Super Harsh Guide to Machine Learning First, read fucking Hastie, Tibshirani, and whoever. Chapters 1-4 and 7-8. If you don't understand it, keep reading it until you do. 

You can read the rest of the book if you want. You probably should, but I'll assume you know all of it. 

Take Andrew Ng's Coursera. Do all the exercises in python and R. Make sure you get the same answers with all of them. 

Now forget all of that and read the deep learning book. Put tensorflow and pytorch on a Linux box and run examples until you get it. Do stuff with CNNs and RNNs and just feed forward NNs.

Once you do all of that, go on arXiv and read the most recent useful papers. The literature changes every few months, so keep up. 

There. Now you can probably be hired most places. If you need resume filler, so some Kaggle competitions. If you have debugging questions, use StackOverflow. If you have math questions, read more. If you have life questions, I have no idea."

I understand that a MLE does not work only with the sexy machine learning models part, but also with all the CI/CD, migration to production, ML pipelines and all things related to automating the running of the model and training. What are the skills, platforms, softwares and other technical skills I need to learn to start moving towards that role?"
machine learning research,"Machine Learning Engineer Early Career Roles I have anecdotally seen fewer early career/new grad machine learning engineer positions open since the downturn in the software engineering industry and the layoffs. 

This parallels the paucity of early career SWE positions in the wider software engineering industry. Any insight as to whether this is transient, or companies going forward may be less inclined to hire early career ML engineers in the future and make do with their current ML engineers?"
machine learning research,"How much of stats and math do we REALLY need for Machine learning engineer? Hello,

I am asking about the MLE that create models and also deploy then. 

In my team we have two type of data scientists:
- one that is very good in kaggle but don't know stats and math deeply.
- other that has a deep understanding in maths and stats. 

Both can create good models. 

I am asking about MLE because, most companies that has this name instead of DS looks like to have more mature in data science culture. 

What's your opinion about this?

Edit: I am talk about the MLE/DS that in majory percent of time create models and not do analysis like: which features cause the trend (causal inference example)"
machine learning research,"Do you think AI/machine learning is a very important field to get into for future relevance? I am just starting to learn about it this week and thinking it is really going to be integral in the years to come right?

So, good to get onboard now.

I think my last great decision was learning coding around 2016 and this is going to be another great one in terms of time management and where to focus your efforts.

Not only yes but interested to hear what fields it will be relevant in? All?

EDIT: seems this is going off what I intended. I am not actually looking for a new career path. I am more just interested in knowing what future implementations will/might be as it becomes more ubiquitous, just speculating what that might be."

machine learning research,"[D] The machine learning community has a toxicity problem It is omnipresent!

**First** of all, the peer-review process is *broken*. Every fourth NeurIPS submission is put on arXiv. There are DeepMind researchers publicly going after reviewers who are criticizing their ICLR submission. On top of that, papers by well-known institutes that were put on arXiv are accepted at top conferences, despite the reviewers agreeing on rejection. In contrast, vice versa, some papers with a majority of accepts are overruled by the AC. (I don't want to call any names, just have a look the openreview page of this year's ICRL).

**Secondly,** there is a *reproducibility crisis*. Tuning hyperparameters on the test set seem to be the standard practice nowadays. Papers that do not beat the current state-of-the-art method have a zero chance of getting accepted at a good conference. As a result, hyperparameters get tuned and subtle tricks implemented to observe a gain in performance where there isn't any.

**Thirdly,** there is a *worshiping* problem. Every paper with a Stanford or DeepMind affiliation gets praised like a breakthrough. For instance, BERT has seven times more citations than ULMfit. The Google affiliation gives so much credibility and visibility to a paper. At every ICML conference, there is a crowd of people in front of every DeepMind poster, regardless of the content of the work. The same story happened with the Zoom meetings at the virtual ICLR 2020. Moreover, NeurIPS 2020 had twice as many submissions as ICML, even though both are top-tier ML conferences. Why? Why is the name ""neural"" praised so much? Next, Bengio, Hinton, and LeCun are truly deep learning pioneers but calling them the ""godfathers"" of AI is insane. It has reached the level of a cult.

**Fourthly**, the way Yann LeCun talked about biases and fairness topics was insensitive. However, the *toxicity* and backlash that he received are beyond any reasonable quantity. Getting rid of LeCun and silencing people won't solve any issue.

**Fifthly**, machine learning, and computer science in general, have a huge *diversity problem*. At our CS faculty, only 30% of undergrads and 15% of the professors are women. Going on parental leave during a PhD or post-doc usually means the end of an academic career. However, this lack of diversity is often abused as an excuse to shield certain people from any form of criticism.  Reducing every negative comment in a scientific discussion to race and gender creates a toxic environment. People are becoming afraid to engage in fear of being called a racist or sexist, which in turn reinforces the diversity problem.

**Sixthly**, moral and ethics are set *arbitrarily*. The U.S. domestic politics dominate every discussion. At this very moment, thousands of Uyghurs are put into concentration camps based on computer vision algorithms invented by this community, and nobody seems even remotely to care. Adding a ""broader impact"" section at the end of every people will not make this stop. There are huge shitstorms because a researcher wasn't mentioned in an article. Meanwhile, the 1-billion+ people continent of Africa is virtually excluded from any meaningful ML discussion (besides a few Indaba workshops).

**Seventhly**, there is a cut-throat publish-or-perish *mentality*. If you don't publish 5+ NeurIPS/ICML papers per year, you are a looser. Research groups have become so large that the PI does not even know the name of every PhD student anymore. Certain people submit 50+ papers per year to NeurIPS. The sole purpose of writing a paper has become to having one more NeurIPS paper in your CV. Quality is secondary; passing the peer-preview stage has become the primary objective.

**Finally**, discussions have become *disrespectful*. Schmidhuber calls Hinton a thief, Gebru calls LeCun a white supremacist, Anandkumar calls Marcus a sexist, everybody is under attack, but nothing is improved.

Albert Einstein was opposing the theory of [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein#Einstein's_objections_to_quantum_mechanics). Can we please stop demonizing those who do not share our exact views. We are allowed to disagree without going for the jugular. 

The moment we start silencing people because of their opinion is the moment scientific and societal progress dies. 

Best intentions, Yusuf"

machine learning research,"Should r/MachineLearning join the reddit blackout to protest changes to their API? Hello there, r/MachineLearning,

Recently, Reddit has announced some [changes to their API](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/13wshdp/api_update_continued_access_to_our_api_for/) that may have pretty serious impact on many of it's users.

[You may have already seen quite a few posts like these](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) across some of the other subreddits that you browse, so we're just going to cut to the chase.

# What's Happening

Third Party Reddit apps (such as Apollo, Reddit is Fun and others) are going to become ludicrously more expensive for it's developers to run, which will in turn either kill the apps, or result in a monthly fee to the users if they choose to use one of those apps to browse. Put simply, each request to Reddit within these mobile apps will cost the developer money. The developers of Apollo [were quoted around $2 million per month](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/) for the current rate of usage. The only way for these apps to continue to be viable for the developer is if you (the user) pay a monthly fee, and realistically, this is most likely going to just outright kill them. **Put simply: If you use a third party app to browse Reddit, you will most likely no longer be able to do so, or be charged a monthly fee to keep it viable.**

In lieu of what's happening, [an open letter](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13xh1e7/an_open_letter_on_the_state_of_affairs_regarding/) has been released by the broader moderation community. Part of this initiative includes a potential subreddit blackout (meaning, the subreddit will be privatized) on June 12th, lasting 24-48 hours or longer. On one hand, this is great to hopefully make enough of an impact to influence Reddit to change their minds on this. On the other hand, we usually stay out of these blackouts, and we would rather not negatively impact usage of the subreddit.

We would like to give the community a voice in this. Is this an important enough matter that r/machinelearning should fully support the protest and blackout the subreddit on June 12th? Feel free to leave your thoughts and opinions below. 

Also, please use up/downvotes for this submission to make yourself heard: upvote: r/ML should join the protest, downvote: r/ML should not join the protest."

There is a tl;dr at the end of the post.

#Introduction

When picking in the top-10 of a draft, teams have one goal: select a franchise-altering player with star potential. Though some teams draft for need and prefer to select more NBA-ready players, in general, GMs do their best to select a player who may become a star.

This is very challenging. Many factors affect a player‚Äôs ability to become a star. Along with college performance, factors like athleticism, intangibles, injuries, coaching, and more change a player‚Äôs star potential.

As fans on the outside looking in, we have limited information on most of these factors except one: college performance. Though even the college performance of many players needs context (such as Cam Reddish‚Äôs low volume stats due to playing with Zion Williamson and R.J. Barrett), it‚Äôs one of the only quantifiable factors we can use. So, let‚Äôs try to use college stats to predict All-Stars in the top-10 of the 2019 draft.

***

#Methods

First, I created a database of every top-10 pick from the 1990-2015 NBA drafts. We use 1990 as the limit because it ensures every player played their entire college career with a 3-point line. The 2015 draft was set as an upper limit so that all players played the entirety of their rookie contract, giving them some chance to make an All-Star team.

In addition to collecting their college stats, I marked whether the prospect made an All-Star team. There is no consideration for whether the player became an All-Star while on the team that drafted him, how long it took him to get there, etc. All data was collected from Sports-Reference.

Players who made an All-Star team at some point in their career earned a ‚Äú1‚Äù in the All-Star column. Meanwhile, players who failed to make an All-Star team earned a ‚Äú0.‚Äù

This represents a binary classification problem. There are two classes we‚Äôre looking at: All-Star and not All-Star. The models try to match each player to one of the two classes. We‚Äôll also look at the prediction probability (probability for the player to be in the class) the models give each player.

To create the models, we used the following stats as inputs:

|Counting stats|Efficiency|Other|
:--|:--|:--|
|PPG|TS%|Pick|
|TRB|3PAr|SOS|
|AST|FTr||
|STL|||
|BLK|||

Note that win shares, box plus/minus, and other holistic advanced stats that are excluded. College BPM data is available only from the 2011 draft, and college WS data is available only from the 1996 draft. Therefore, using BPM restricts the data set massively. Though adding WS only excludes 6 years of drafts, the models were significantly less accurate when including WS.

The models predicted whether the player made an All-Star team (the 1s or 0s described above).

We collected the same set of stats for the top-10 picks in the 2019 draft. When using the models to All-Stars out of the 2019 draft, we‚Äôll look primarily at the prediction probabilities of the positive class. A prediction probability of 0.75 indicates that the model is 75% certain the player will fall into class 1 (All-Star). Therefore, every player with a prediction probability above 0.5 would be predicted as a 1 if we just used the models to predict classes instead of probability.

Given that about 31% of top-10 picks since 1990, the prediction probabilities give us more information about the predictions. If we‚Äôd just predict the classes, we‚Äôd likely get 2-4 1s, and the rest be 0s. However, with the prediction probabilities, we can see whether a player has a higher All-Star probability than others drafted at his pick historically, making him a seemingly good value.

Note that unlike other problems like predicting All-NBA teams ‚Äì where voters have general tendencies making the problem easy to predict accurately ‚Äì predicting All-Stars is incredibly difficult. Players develop differently, and college stats alone are not nearly enough to accurately project a player‚Äôs All-Star potential. We don‚Äôt expect the models to incredibly accurate. After all, if they were, teams would use better models higher quality data to make predictions that would help them always pick All-Stars.

In total, we made four models:

1. Logistic classifier (LOG)
2. Support vector classifier (SVC)
3. Random forest classifier (RF)
4. Gradient boosting classifier (GBC)

***

#Comparing All-Star and not All-Star stats

Let‚Äôs compare some college stats between All-Stars and not All-Stars. This will illustrate just how difficult it is to differentiate the two groups based off just their college stats.

Before diving into the differences (or lack thereof), let‚Äôs first establish how to read these plots. This type of graph is called a boxplot. The yellow line represents the median or middle value in each group. The top of the box signifies the 75th percentile, while the bottom of the box signifies the 25th percentile. So, the 25th-50th percentile can be seen between the bottom of the box and the yellow line. From the yellow line to the top of the box represents the 50th-75th percentile. The full box represents the 25th-75th percentile of the data.

The lines flowing out of the box are called ‚Äúwhiskers.‚Äù The top of the whisker, or the ‚ÄúT‚Äù shape, represents the greatest value, excluding outliers. The bottom whisker represents the opposite (the lowest value excluding outliers). From the top of the box to the top of the whisker represents the 75th-100th percentile. The bottom of the box to the bottom of the whisker represents the 0th-25th percentile. Therefore, the top of the box also represents the median of the upper half of the data set.

The dots above or below the whiskers represent outliers. Outliers above the whiskers represent points that are greater than the upper quartile (top of the box) + 1.5 times then interquartile range (top of the box ‚Äì bottom of the box). Outliers below the whiskers represent points that are less than the lower quartile (bottom of the box) ‚Äì 1.5 times then interquartile range (top of the box ‚Äì bottom of the box).

First, let‚Äôs look at their points per game.

https://i.imgur.com/W344Rfe.png

Though the All-Stars have a marginally higher median PPG, the not All-Stars have a higher upper quartile PPG (top of the whisker). Therefore, there‚Äôs no clear difference here between the two groups, especially given that the bottom whiskers extend similarly for both groups.

Next, let‚Äôs look at rebounds and assists. Because big men will get more rebounds, and guards will get more assists, All-Stars and not All-Stars seems to be an odd comparison. However, we‚Äôre just looking for differences in basic counting stats.

https://i.imgur.com/P9vayUu.png

https://i.imgur.com/GoSlUqV.png

For rebounds, there‚Äôs practically no difference yet again. Both groups show a nearly identical median and very similar ranges. For assists, the All-Stars have a higher median assist total, and the 25th-75th percentile range stretches higher. Therefore, there‚Äôs a small difference between the two.

Let‚Äôs look at the difference in strength of schedule (SOS).

https://i.imgur.com/ejj28M6.png

Yet again, there‚Äôs a minimal difference. The medians are almost equal. Though the All-Stars range is higher than the not All-Stars range, there are multiple low outliers for the All-Stars.

Lastly, let‚Äôs look at the difference in picks.

https://i.imgur.com/D95LjtS.png

This is the first pronounced difference. The median pick of an All-Star is much lower than that of a not All-Star. Because no other stats showed any significant difference between the two groups, we can expect pick to be the most important feature in the models. Furthermore, this difference shows that NBA GMs are generally pretty good at drafting.

#Model analysis

##Model creation: data transformation

After creating the four models described above and testing their accuracy with basic metrics (discussed later), I did two things.

First, I tried manipulating the data. To make the models, I initially used the raw data. Sometimes, normalizing the data may lead to better performance. Normalizing the data means scaling each individual stat so that the highest value is 1 and the lowest value is 0. This can be done across the entire data set (the player with the highest college PPG would have a PPG input to the models of 1) or to each draft year (the player with the highest college PPG in each draft year would have a PPG input to the models of 1). Neither of these methods increased performance.

Next, I tried transforming the data into ranks. Instead of giving raw or normalized stats, we can simply rank all the players by their stats. Like normalization, this gives us some method to compare the players. However, ranking each stat for neither the entire data set nor each draft year improved performance.

After all, we‚Äôll use the usual, raw data we got from Sports Reference.

##Model creation: hyperparameter tuning

Every model has certain characteristics that determine how the model fits the data. These characteristics, or hyperparameters, make the model‚Äôs architecture. For example, if we were using an exponential model, the degree (quadratic, cubic, quartic, etc.) would be a hyperparameter. Hyperparameters impact the model‚Äôs performance.

In previous posts, I used nice round numbers for the model hyperparameters and played around with them randomly until I found a mix that yielded a strong model. However, this is not scientific.

For a scientific hyperparameter tuning, we can use a method called grid search. Grid search takes a grid of possible values for hyperparameters we want to test, creates a model for each possible combination, evaluates the model‚Äôs accuracy, and returns the ‚Äúbest‚Äù model. In this case, we want to find the model that has the best recall (a metric we‚Äôll discuss soon).

The SVC, RF, and GBC saw their performance improve with the hyperparameters from the grid search. So, for those models, we used the best parameters found by the grid search. For the LOG, we used the parameters we set before the grid search (in this case, the default).

##Basic goodness-of-fit

We measure the performance of classification models in several ways. The simplest metric is accuracy, which measures the percentage of predictions the model made correctly. Essentially, it takes the list of predictions and finds how many values in the list were perfect matches to the list of results.

Because this is the simplest classification metric, it has its flaws. Accuracy only measures correct predictions, so it may be misleading in some cases. For example, if we‚Äôre predicting something very rare, then almost all the results will be 0s. Therefore, a model that exclusively predicts 0s will have a high accuracy even if it has no predictive power.

Given that there are more not All-Stars than All-Stars, accuracy is not the best metric in this case. 30% of the testing set consists of All-Stars, meaning a model could achieve 70% accuracy by predicting all 0s (that no one will be an All-Star). However, because picking correct All-Stars at the expense of picking some incorrect All-Stars is better than picking no All-Stars at all, it‚Äôs fine to have an accuracy less than 70%.

To understand the next few classification metrics, we must first establish some terms. A true positive occurs when the model predicts a 1, and the actual value is a 1 (meaning the model correctly predicted an All-Star). A true negative is the opposite; the model correctly predicts a 0. False positives occur when the model predicts a 1 where the actual value is 0, and false negatives occur when the model predicts a 0 where the actual value is 1.

Recall measures a model‚Äôs ability to predict the positive class. In this case, it‚Äôs the model‚Äôs ability to find all the All-Stars (true positives). Recall = TP / (TP + FN), meaning that a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù model that predicts every positive class correctly will have a recall of 1. Recall is arguably the most important metric here.

Precision measures how many of the returned predicted All-Stars were true. It penalizes the model for incorrectly predicting a bunch of All-Stars. Precision = TP / (TP + FP), meaning that a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù model will have a precision of 1. Notice that there is typically a trade-off between precision and recall given that recall measures ability to find true positives, while precision measures ability to limit false positives.

To combine the two metrics, we can use F1. F1 = 2(precision * recall) / (precision + recall). By combining precision and recall, F1 lets us compare two models with different precisions and recalls. Like recall and precision, F1 values are between 0 and 1, with 1 being the best.

Now that we‚Äôre familiar with some classification metrics, let‚Äôs examine the models‚Äô performance. The table below shows the scores of all four models on the previously mentioned metrics.

|Model|Accuracy|Recall|Precision|F1|
:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|
|LOG|0.746|0.316|0.667|0.429|
|SVC|0.762|0.263|0.833|0.4|
|RF|0.746|0.368|0.636|0.467|
|GBC|0.73|0.368|0.583|0.452|

The RF and GBC had the highest recall, though the RF had higher precision and accuracy than the GBC. Although the SVC had the highest precision and accuracy, we‚Äôre most concerned with recall, meaning the other models are stronger. The LOG appears slightly weaker than the RF and GBC, though it‚Äôs still a strong model.

As mentioned before, we‚Äôre not expecting dazzling performance from the models. After all, if models using publicly available data could predict All-Stars, NBA teams with full analytics staffs would have no problem finding them. Therefore, though these metrics are not encouraging by themselves, they show that the models have some predictive power.

##Improvement over random

To show that the models are stronger than randomly predicting All-Stars, I made a dummy classifier. The dummy classifier randomly predicts players to be a 1 or 0 with respect to the training set‚Äôs class distribution. Given that the training set had 32% All-Stars (the testing set had 30% as mentioned earlier), the dummy classifier will randomly predict 32% of the testing set to be All-Stars.

The table below shows the dummy classifier‚Äôs performance.

|Model|Accuracy|Recall|Precision|F1|
:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|
|Dummy|0.556|0.316|0.286|0.3|

Each of our four models has higher accuracy, precision, and F1 scores than the dummy classifier. It is slightly concerning that the dummy classifier has equal recall to the LOG and higher recall than the SVC. Nevertheless, the LOG and SVC were much better at getting their All-Star predictions correct when they did predict them (higher precision).

##Confusion matrices

To help visualize a model‚Äôs accuracy, we can use a confusion matrix. A confusion matrix shows the predicted vs. actual classes in the test set for each model. It plots each model‚Äôs true positives (bottom right), true negatives (top left), false positive (top right), and false negatives (bottom left) in a square.

The testing set was small; it had only 63 data points. Below are the confusion matrices for all four models.

https://i.imgur.com/H1DeMjc.png

https://i.imgur.com/kTgdOrV.png

https://i.imgur.com/jgQmTDV.png

https://i.imgur.com/NjcmZW9.png

##Cross-validation

As we do in other machine learning posts, we want to cross-validate our models. This will ensure that they didn‚Äôt ‚Äúmemorize‚Äù the correct weights for this specific split of data, meaning they overfit.

In classification problems, it‚Äôs important to see that the class balance is close to even between the training and testing set. This could influence cross-validation, given that a different split of the data might have a large imbalance. Our training set had 32% All-Stars while our testing set had 30% All-Stars, making this a non-factor.

The table below shows the cross-validated accuracy (k = 3) and the scores‚Äô 95% confidence interval.

|Model|CV accuracy|95% confidence interval|
:--|--:|:--|
|LOG|0.665|+/- 0.096|
|SVC|0.683|+/- 0.027|
|RF|0.746|+/- 0.136|
|GBC|0.633|+/- 0.135|

Every model has a cross-validated accuracy score that‚Äôs close to its real accuracy score.

##Log loss and ROC curves

The final metrics we‚Äôll use are log loss and ROC curves.

Log loss is essentially like accuracy with prediction probabilities instead of predicted classes. Lower log loss is better. Because we‚Äôre interested in the prediction probabilities, log loss is an important metric here. Though log loss isn‚Äôt exactly simple to interpret by itself, it‚Äôs useful for comparing models.

The table below shows the four models‚Äô log loss values.

|Model|Log loss|
:--|--:|
|LOG|0.546|
|SVC|0.56|
|RF|0.556|
|GBC|1.028|

The biggest takeaway from the log loss is that the GBC may not be as strong as we initially thought, given that all the other models have significantly lower log loss scores.

The second to last metric we‚Äôll look at is the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve and the area under it. The curve shows the ‚Äúseparation‚Äù between true positives and true negatives by plotting them against each other. The area gives us a numerical value for this separation.

A model with no overlap in probability between TP and TN (perfect) would have a right-angled ROC curve and an area under the curve of 1. As the overlap increases (meaning the model is worse) the curve gets closer to the line y = x.

The ROC curves and the area under the curve for each model is below.

https://i.imgur.com/kmGla77.png

Each model has a similar ROC curve and area under the curve.

***

#Why do the models predict what they do?

Before going into the results, the last thing we‚Äôll want to look at is what the models find important in predicting All-Stars. There are a couple ways to do this.

First, we‚Äôll look at the model coefficients and feature importances. The LOG and SVC have coefficients, while the RF and GBC have feature importances. Coefficients are different from feature importances in that the coefficients are used to express the model in an equation. Higher coefficients do not mean the feature is more important, they just mean the model scaled that feature differently. On their own, they don‚Äôt have much meaning for us, but for comparison purposes, we can see which model scales a certain factor more.

The graph below shows the coefficients of the LOG and SVC.

https://i.imgur.com/MjISg1X.png

The two models have very similar coefficients for the most part. The two main differences are in the steals and blocks coefficients. While the LOG gives blocks a negative coefficient, the SVC gives it a positive coefficient. Furthermore, the LOG gives steals a much higher coefficient than the SVC.

Next, let‚Äôs look at feature importances. Feature importance shows how much the model relies on a feature by measuring how much the model‚Äôs error increases without it. Higher feature importance indicates more reliance on the feature.

The graph below shows the feature importances of the RF and GBC.

https://i.imgur.com/mNUa0SW.png

As we would expect, pick was the most important feature for both models (the GBC point covers the RF point). Interestingly, SOS was almost as important to the GBC as pick.

##Shapley values

To get a more detailed view of how each feature impacted each model, we can use a more advanced model explanation metric called Shapley values.

Shapley value is defined as the ‚Äúaverage marginal contribution of a feature value over all possible coalitions.‚Äù It tests every prediction for an instance using every combo of our inputs. This along with other similar methods gives us more information about how much each individual feature affects each model in each case.

First, we‚Äôll look at the mean SHAP value, or average impact of each feature on each of the four models. A higher value indicates a more important feature.

The four graphs below show the mean SHAP values for each of the four models (in order of LOG, SVC, RF, GBC).

https://i.imgur.com/2zv7BGd.png

https://i.imgur.com/ysMmlhg.png

https://i.imgur.com/GqRoVj7.png

https://i.imgur.com/51GcrlK.png

The LOG, RF, and GBC all have pick as the most important feature, as expected. Steals being the second most important feature is surprising. The three models all have pick, steals, rebounds, and assists in their top-5 most important features.

The SVC has odd results, as pick was only the third most important feature behind rebounds and assists.

To get a more detailed and individualized view of the feature impacts, we can look at the SHAP value for each point.

In the graphs below, the x-axis represents the SHAP value. The higher the magnitude on the x-axis (very positive or very negative), the more the feature impacts the model. The color indicates the feature value, with red being high values and blue being low values. So, a blue point for pick indicates the player was picked early.

With these plots, we can make conclusions like ‚Äúpick is very important to the models when its value is low but becomes less important as players are picked later.‚Äù

The four graphs below show the individual point SHAP and feature values.

https://i.imgur.com/FbarVSw.png

https://i.imgur.com/HKheCGM.png

https://i.imgur.com/CUSmVbd.png

https://i.imgur.com/puJObd8.png

For the LOG, pick mattered a lot when its value was low. As players were picked later, it had less of an impact on model output. The SVC was more affected by high assists, rebounds, and steal values than low pick values, unlike other models.

Rebounds had minimal impact on the RF except for cases where the player‚Äôs rebound total was very low. The opposite is true for TS% in both the RF and GBC; generally, TS% had minimal impact on the model except for the highest TS% values. For the GBC, the highest SOS values had a very high impact on model output.

***

#Results

To make predictions for the 2019 draft, we looked at prediction probabilities instead of predicted classes. This gives us each model‚Äôs probability that the player makes an All-Star team.

The four graphs below show each model‚Äôs predictions.

https://i.imgur.com/RohPa4F.png

https://i.imgur.com/mIlxG9X.png

https://i.imgur.com/HqmnVoc.png

https://i.imgur.com/9wKvXAY.png

Every model gives Zion the highest All-Star probability. The LOG and SVC‚Äôs top-3 in All-Star probability mimic the draft‚Äôs top-3. However, the RF and GBC love Jaxson Hayes; both models gave him the second-highest All-Star probability, just above Ja Morant. Both the RF and GBC also dislike DeAndre Hunter, giving him the lowest All-Star probability.

The graph below shows the average prediction of the four models.

https://i.imgur.com/c9JSRWj.png

The RF and GBC propel Jaxson Hayes to the fourth-highest average predicted All-Star probability.

The table below shows each model's predictions and the average of the predictions.

|Pick|Player|LOG|SVC|RF|GBC|Average|
--:|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
|1|Zion Williamson|0.71|0.63|0.80|1.00|0.78|
|2|Ja Morant|0.65|0.49|0.58|0.91|0.66|
|3|RJ Barrett|0.37|0.49|0.53|0.62|0.50|
|4|DeAndre Hunter|0.22|0.23|0.16|0.00|0.15|
|5|Darius Garland|0.19|0.24|0.42|0.10|0.23|
|6|Jarrett Culver|0.25|0.30|0.48|0.47|0.37|
|7|Coby White|0.15|0.27|0.31|0.16|0.22|
|8|Jaxson Hayes|0.08|0.17|0.61|0.94|0.45|
|9|Rui Hachimura|0.07|0.11|0.17|0.00|0.09|
|10|Cam Reddish|0.10|0.20|0.35|0.28|0.23|

To determine the best value picks according to the models, we can compare each player‚Äôs predicted All-Star probability to the percent of players drafted in his slot that made an All-Star team in our data set (1990-2015 drafts). So, if a first pick and a tenth pick both have 80% All-Star probability, the tenth pick will be a better relative value because many more first picks make All-Star teams.

The graph below shows the All-Star probability minus the percent of players drafted in the slot that make an All-Star team for each player.

https://i.imgur.com/Akivph3.png

The graph below sorts the difference from greatest to least.

https://i.imgur.com/IySAp4R.png

The models love Ja Morant and Jaxson Hayes as great values. Meanwhile, the models dislike the #4 and #5 picks ‚Äì DeAndre Hunter and Darius Garland.

Part of the reason Morant has such a large difference is that #2 picks have an unusually low All-Star total. The table below shows the difference in All-Star probability. Notice that only 40% of #2 picks in our data set made an All-Star team, while 56% of #3 picks made one.

|Pick|Player|All-Star % at pick # since 1990|Average prediction|Difference|
--:|:--|--:|--:|--:|
|1|Zion Williamson|0.64|0.78|0.14|
|2|Ja Morant|0.4|0.66|0.26|
|3|RJ Barrett|0.56|0.50|-0.06|
|4|DeAndre Hunter|0.32|0.15|-0.17|
|5|Darius Garland|0.4|0.23|-0.17|
|6|Jarrett Culver|0.24|0.37|0.13|
|7|Coby White|0.08|0.22|0.14|
|8|Jaxson Hayes|0.2|0.45|0.25|
|9|Rui Hachimura|0.16|0.09|-0.07|
|10|Cam Reddish|0.12|0.23|0.11|

#Conclusion

Because predicting All-Stars is difficult and depends on more than just college stats, our models are not objectively accurate. Nevertheless, they can provide insight into the All-Star probabilities of the top-10 picks of this year‚Äôs draft.

Each of the four models predicts Zion is the most likely player to make an All-Star team. Two of the models give the second spot to Morant, while two of the models give the spot to Jaxson Hayes. Relative to historical All-Stars drafted at each slot, Morant and Hayes appear to be great values, while Hunter and Garland appear poor values.

# Introduction

With James Harden's recent stretch, the Nuggets' success despite their injuries, and the Bucks maintaining the second seed in the NBA, Harden, Jokic, and Giannis all have strong cases for MVP this year. Though Harden hasn't had the same team success as Jokic and Giannis, he's been averaging an absurd 34.2 PPG - almost 5 PPG more than second place Steph Curry. On the other hand, Jokic has been leading an injury-riddled Nuggets team to the first seed in the West. Along the way, he's had numerous incredible all-around performances, such as Monday's 40/10/8 game against the Trail Blazers. Jokic averages the 9th most assists per game in the league, an unprecedented figure for a center. Meanwhile, Giannis has been posting a hyper-efficient 27/12/6 while leading the Bucks to the NBA's second best record. In addition to these players, Curry and Kawhi have legitimate arguments for MVP, as they've played very well for the best teams in the league.

For much of the beginning of the season, many saw Giannis as the MVP favorite. However, the race seems tighter now than ever.

To predict who will win MVP now that we're just past the season's midway point, I created various models that try to predict this year's MVP.

***

#Methods

This post uses very similar methods to [my post that analyzed the least and most deserving MVPs of the past decade](https://dribbleanalytics.blogspot.com/2018/08/least-most-deserving-mvps.html). Like the initial MVP post, I use a database of all players who placed top-10 in MVP voting since the 1979-1980 season (when the 3-point line was introduced). I measured the following stats for these players:

| Counting stats | Advanced stats| MVP votes | Team stats |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------- |
| G | WS | MVP votes won | Wins |
| MPG | WS/48 | Maximum MVP votes | Overall seed |
| PTS/G | VORP | Share of MVP votes* |  |
| TRB/G | BPM | |
| AST/G | | |
| STL/G | | |
| BLK/G | | |
| FG% | | |
| 3P% | | |
| FT% | | |

*Share of MVP votes = % of maximum votes received (so Curry's unanimous MVP is a vote share of 1).

For both this season and lockout seasons, I scaled up win shares, VORP, and wins to an 82 game season.

My initial MVP post used many of the above stats to predict vote share. The new models used in this post use fewer parameters, as several of the parameters in the previous post introduced collinearity. For example, having VORP, BPM, and MPG together is bad, as VORP adjusts BPM to MPG. For these models, I used only the following stats as parameters:

| Counting stats | Advanced stats | Team stats |
| ------------- | -------------- | ---------- |
| PTS/G | VORP | Wins |
| TRB/G | WS | Overall seed |
| AST/G | | |
| FG% | | |

Using these parameters to predict vote share, I created 4 models:

1. Support vector regression (SVM)
2. Random forest regression (RF)
3. k-nearest neighbors regression (KNN)
4. Deep neural network (DNN)

Unlike the previous MVP post, the models were trained and tested using all data from the 1979-1980 season up until the 2017-2018 season. They then predict the MVP from this year's data. I predicted the MVP vote share for the top-10 players on NBA.com's January 11th MVP ladder.

***

#Where the models fall short

Like we discussed in the previous MVP post, the MVP isn't determined only by who has the best stats. Because the models only know stats, they can't account for other factors that a media member considers when voting for MVP. These include:

- Narrative
- Expectations; the models don't know that the Nuggets weren't expected to be this good
- Popularity; the models don't know that Giannis and Harden are much more popular players than Jokic
- How someone scores their points; the models don't know that Harden shoots a lot of free throws
- Triple doubles and other arbitrary thresholds

Given that the models can't account for these factors, one way we can think about these predictions is that I'm evaluating who has the most MVP-like stats out of the players.

***

#Understanding the data

The models predict the vote share for each of the players who were top-10 in MVP votes. It's important to note that most players will have a very low vote share, as there's usually only a few legitimate MVP contenders; the rest usually get some last place votes. To understand this distribution, I plotted a histogram of the vote share (see below).

https://i.imgur.com/4KmOOgZ.png

As expected, the distribution is not normal. Most of the players had a vote share less than 0.2. This is important to consider, as a skewed dataset like this introduces more variance to the models.

***

#Regression analysis

## Basic goodness-of-fit and cross-validation

The table below shows the r-squared and mean squared error for each of the four models. A higher r-squared and lower mean squared error indicate a more accurate model.

| Model | r-squared | Mean squared error |
| ----- | --------- | ------------------ |
| SVM | 0.708 | 0.028 |
| RF | 0.628 | 0.035 |
| KNN | 0.633 | 0.035 |
| DNN | 0.619 | 0.036 |

As with the previous MVP post, the models don't have a very high r-squared. For the most part, the models have a higher r-squared and lower mean squared error than the previous post's models, as they had more data. Though the r-squared isn't great, the mean squared is very low. In most MVP races, the winner had a vote share advantage over second place above 0.1. Therefore, because of the low mean squared error compared to the actual vote share difference, we can expect the models to be accurate in predicting the MVP.

To ensure the models aren't overfitting - or just learning the correct coefficients that yield the best results given the specific split - I performed k-fold cross-validation for r-squared. Ideally, the cross-validated r-squared will be close to the r-squared mentioned above. This would mean the models perform equally well when tested on a different split of the data. The table below shows the cross-validated r-squared scores and their 95% confidence intervals.

| Model | CV r-squared | 95% confidence interval |
| ----- | ------------ | ----------------------- |
| SVM | 0.63 | +/- 0.10 |
| RF | 0.50 | +/- 0.17 |
| KNN | 0.53 | +/- 0.15 |
| DNN | 0.57 | +/- 0.02 |

All the models have a cross-validated r-squared that's decently lower than the initial r-squared. Furthermore, the confidence intervals are wide. Therefore, it's possible the models are overfitting and may perform slightly worse on different data. However, even with these low r-squared values, the mean squared error on different datasets will not change drastically - it'll still be smaller than the usual difference between the MVP winner and second place.

##Standardized residuals test

A standardized residuals test analyzes the difference between the model's predicted and actual values on historical data. To pass the test, the models have at least 95% of their standardized residuals within 2 standard deviations of the mean and have no noticeable trend. Passing the standardized residuals test gives us a first indication that the models' errors are random.

The graph below shows the standardized residuals of all four models.

https://i.imgur.com/GIpOQ9u.png

Only the RF fails the standardized residuals test. Furthermore, there is no noticeable trend. The only concerning result from the test is the high number of values greater than 2 and below -2. This indicates high variance in the models. However, it's important to note the skewed data likely contributes to this variance.

##Q-Q plot

While the standardized residuals test determines if the errors are random, a Q-Q (quantile-quantile) plot examines if the errors are normally distributed. Normally distributed errors are important because they indicate that the model will perform similarly across the entirety of a dataset. In making a Q-Q plot, we're looking for the models' residuals to be as close to a 45-degree (y = x) line as possible - that indicates a normal distribution.

The graph below is the Q-Q plot for all four models' residuals.

https://i.imgur.com/UZ1n8CH.png

Though all four models appear to have residuals pretty close to the red y = x line, there are some considerable jumps at the upper quantiles of the residuals. Each models' residuals appear to be slightly bow-shaped; they rise above the red line at the lower quantiles, fall below it in the middle, and rise again at the upper quantiles. Therefore, it's unlikely the residuals are normally distributed.

##Shapiro-Wilk test

To truly determine that the residuals are normally distributed, I performed a Shapiro-Wilk test. While the Q-Q plots give a graphical representation of normality, the Shapiro-Wilk test - which returns a W-value between 0 and 1, with 1 meaning the sample is perfectly normal - gives a mathematical answer.

In addition to the W-value, the test returns a p-value. The null hypothesis of the test is that the data is normally distributed. Therefore, a p-value &lt; 0.05 means the data is not normally distributed, as we reject the null hypothesis when p &lt; 0.05.

The table below shows the results of the Shapiro-Wilk test.

| Model | W-value | p-value |
| ----- | ------- | ------- |
| SVM | 0.94 | &lt; 0.01 |
| RF | 0.88 | &lt; 0.01 |
| KNN | 0.90 | &lt; 0.01 |
| DNN | 0.97 | 0.04 |

The results confirm what we suspected from the Q-Q plot; no model returned normally distributed residuals. Though this is concerning, it doesn't invalidate the models.

##Durbin-Watson test

The Durbin-Watson test examines whether the models' residuals have autocorrelation, meaning there is a self-repeating trned in the residuals. Essentially, if the models have significant autocorrelation, they're making the same mistake over and over. The test returns a value between 0 and 4, where a value of 2 indicates no autocorrelation. Values between 0 and 2 indicate positive autocorrelation, meaning if one point is higher than the previous, then the next point is likely to be even higher. Values between 2 and 4 indicate negative autocorrelation, meaning that the points are likely to have the opposite change from the previous points.

The table below shows the results of the Durbin-Watson test.

| Model | DW-value |
| ----- | -------- |
| SVM | 1.77 |
| RF | 1.81 |
| KNN | 1.85 |
| DNN | 1.69 |

All the DW-values are between 1.5 and 2, indicating there's minimal autocorrelation.

##Would we benefit from more data?

Currently, the data has two limits. First, it only goes back to the 1979-80 season so that it only includes players in the 3-point era. Second, it only includes players top-10 in MVP votes, so we could gain a few more datapoints by including everyone who received MVP votes.

I think the second limitation would hurt the models if removed, as it would further skew the distribution toward low vote shares. To examine if we'd benefit from more data, I plotted the learning curve for r-squared and mean squared error (MSE) for each model.

https://i.imgur.com/cCy7ZFe.png

https://i.imgur.com/N3Bnmch.png

The lines appear to get very close for the SVM and DNN, meaning more data is unlikely to help. However, for the KNN and RF, it's possible more data may increase the models' accuracy. Given the primary way to add data to this problem is to consider all players who received votes - which skews the data - adding more data probably won't help the models.

# Results

The 4 graphs below show each model's results. Each player's current rank in NBA.com's MVP ladder. Note that these predictions were made using data from 1/14 before the games were played.

All four models have Giannis as the winner, and Harden as the runner-up. Two models have Jokic coming in third, and the other two models (which have KD and Anthony Davis in third) have Jokic in fourth.

The graph below is the average predicted vote share of the four models for each player.

https://i.imgur.com/OsaEkpH.png

The average shows that the models have Giannis winning MVP by a decent margin. Harden also has a decent margin on Jokic.

#Conclusion

The models crown Giannis as the MVP half-way through the year. Note that the models can't account for narrative, expectations, or voter fatigue; it's purely a statistical view.

This may change soon, as Harden scored 57 points the night I ran this analysis. With Capela out for the foreseeable and the Rockets still missing key pieces in Chris Paul and Eric Gordon, it's possible Harden ramps up his already absurd scoring pace, making a strong case for MVP. I'll run the models again with new data around the All-Star break to see if Harden caught up.

machine learning research,"Using Machine Learning to Find Modern Goalkeepers in Europe Last thursday's debacle appeared to be the nail in the coffin for David De Gea. At least from a fan's perspective. The reality is, we will never be able to reach the recent heights that Manchester City and Liverpool have reached, without a playmking goalkeeper.

It is extremely clear that ETH wants us to build from the back more, but this process is impeded by DDG's on the ball abilities. So I decided to use some simple machine learning algorithms to try to seeth through all the goalkeepers in the top 5 leagues, and identify viable, playmaking GK targets.

All data comes from: [https://fbref.com/en/comps/Big5/keepersadv/players/Big-5-European-Leagues-Stats](https://fbref.com/en/comps/Big5/keepersadv/players/Big-5-European-Leagues-Stats)

## The Metrics

Before I go into the metrics used, let me clarify something. On all my charts, I want the high value to mean ""good."" However, some values, like ""Avg Length of Pass"" are ""good"" when they're smallest - as this would indicate a GK's tendency to play shorter passes. So I've reversed those values on the charts so that a high value still means good. This is why some variables, (listed below) start with the prefix ""Rev."" Note also that all values on the charts have been standardized (scaled to be between 0 and 1.)

If this is too confusing, just remember this - on the charts, the higher the value looks, the ""better"" it is for that metric for a playmaking GK.

I will evaluate playmaking keepers based on 8 metrics, listed below. All stats per 90.

* **Passes\_Att**: The number of passes attempted, not including GK.
* **Rev\_Goal Kicks\_AvgLen**: The average length of a Goal Kick pass.
* **Rev\_Goal Kicks\_Launch%**: The percentage of Goal Kicks that were launched (passes greater than 40 yards).
* **Rev\_Passes\_AvgLen**: The average length of a **Non** Goal Kick pass.
* **Rev\_Passes\_Launch%**: The percentage of **Non** Goal Kicks passes that were launched (passes greater than 40 yards).
* **Sweeper\_AvgDist**: The average distance from goal in all defensive actions.
* **Sweeper\_#OPA**: Defensive actions outside of the penalty area.
* **Crosses\_Stp%**: Percentage of crosses in the penalty area that were successfully stopped by the GK.

## The Problem

## Far from the Elite

So let's see how DDG compares to two of the best playmaking goal keepers, Alisson and Ederson. Note that I'm not doing this to harp on DDG. I just want to show how these metrics really are reflective of playmaking GKs, and establish a foundation for what we need to look out for.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p39rkwsgeava1.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=290ba99e6e2ff9bfc41485a4015c00f025c0b2b8

To the surprise of absolutely no one, Alisson and Ederson far outperform DDG in all metrics. They play more passes per game, shorter passes both from goal kicks and open play, launch a much smaller percentage of both goal kicks and open play passes (suggesting a higher tendency for short passes.) They are also both better sweeper keepers, although Alisson is a much better sweeper keeper than Ederson. But they both have very good command of their penalty box.

## Inability to Build up from Goal Kicks

Now, it feels a little unfair to compare him to two of the best playmaking GKs, so let's compare him to the average keeper across the top 5 leagues.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uguu9tyheava1.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=171f157e6150c57e3231d2bed644701de23a63e3

So there are a lot of things that are bad here. Overall, he's basically worst than the average GK in all the top 5 leagues. But there are certain areas that are more important that others. He's slightly above average in open play passes, but when it comes to goal kicks, he's far worst than the rest.

This essentially means that we end up launching most of our goal kicks, which takes away from our inability to play from the back. Notice also how his passes attempted are very low, suggesting that he has very minimal involvement in the build up.

## Takeaway

Okay so, now, hopefully, you will trust that those metrics are indicative of playmaking GK. And understand what we are really missing with DDG. So time for the machine learning to come in.

## Clustering Analysis.

So, we will use a very basic clustering analysis here, called K-means. I'm not going to go in the details of the algorithm or other steps that I took to run it, but at a high level, K-means is an algorithm that finds clusters of goalkeepers with similar abilities.

The goal is that one of those clusters comprises of goalkeepers with good playmaknig attributes, like Alisson and Ederson. And then, we can do a deep dive into goalkeepers within that cluster to find out who we should be targetting.

## Visualizing Clusters

The analysis found 4 clusters in the data, i.e., 4 ""types"" of goal keepers based on their playmaking attributes. One way to visualize it is to use a method called PCA that can essentially reduce all of our 8 attributes into 2, and then visualize the groups by plotting the two newly created attributes:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1yrgy4sjeava1.png?width=571&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ae9fa661b1e03729590b2bdbaa89489907c9295

Each dot in the plot above represents a goalkeeper. The 2 axes are essentially a combination of the 8 variables we started with. So goalkeepers that are close together on both axes, are goalkeepers that share similar playmaking attributes. Here, we can see four groups that our clustering algorithm has identified.

## Describing the Clusters

Now, let's look at the individual goalkeepers within the clusters, and get an average of playmaking stats for each cluster. This will tell us what the clusters really represent.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zgo6yq2leava1.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b07145c031bc03c3e51dc4c93bcddc7d4affe828

The chart above represents the average metric for each goalkeeper in a given cluster. Let's go through them one at a time

* **Cluster 0**: This is the blue cluster that's barely visible because it is so small. This is essentially a cluster where all goalkeepers are bad playmakers on all front, and bad sweepers.
* **Cluster 1**: The red cluster here is by far and away the best cluster. This is the group of goal keepers with the best playmaking abilities, and also goalkeepers with good sweeping abilities
* **Cluster 2**: Good sweepers, bad playmakers. GKs in this cluster have good sweeping attributes, but are typically really bad playmakers.
* **Cluster 3**: Average playmakers, bad sweepers. This is the one DDG is in, but he's a worst playmaker than most in that group.

## Targets from Optimal Clusters

There is clearly one cluster that is optimal here, Cluster 1. So, I took a look at the GKs in cluster 1 and identified realistic targets. First, I removed any unrealistic GK. As you can imagine, Ederson and Alisson were in this group, so the likes of them are not considered realistic.

I put a filter on age - seeing as we should be rebuilding for the future. I only consider GKs who are 30 years old or younger. Lastly, we also want our GK to be good shot stoppers, so I used the PSxGA metric, which is essentially a number that summarizes a GK ability to stop shots. Positive numbers suggest better luck or an above average ability to stop shots. So I filetered the cluster for only positive values of that metric. Below are the identified targets, including DDG as a reference point:

||Player|Squad|Age|Expected\_/90|Passes\_Launch%|Passes\_AvgLen|Goal Kicks\_Launch%|Goal Kicks\_AvgLen|Crosses\_Stp%|Sweeper\_#OPA|Sweeper\_AvgDist|Passes\_Att|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|27|Ivan Provedel|Lazio|29|0.12|28.8|33|35.4|34.7|4.1|1.51|16.6|29.9|
|46|Brice Samba|Lens|29|0.12|34.3|32.7|26.2|29.3|7.3|1.23|16.7|29.2|
|22|Gregor Kobel|Dortmund|26|0.09|21.7|29.4|42.5|37.8|4.9|1.57|17.3|32.7|
|59|Alex Meret|Napoli|26|0.04|14.9|26.2|20.6|27.1|3.4|1.07|17|22|
|75|David de Gea|Manchester Utd|33|\-0.08|31.6|31.6|65.5|48.3|3|0.83|14.5|27.1|

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wg0ah87oeava1.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80d629ac65c78ac643aa68fd27dc282003ce8002

Now, I don't actually know anything about these goalkeepers, I'm just a numbers guy. That being said, they statistically look like better and more modern GKs than DDG. They all have far superior playmaking abilities and sweeping abilities.

## Targets from Sub-Optimal Clusters

We're not done quite yet. There was one more cluster that I described as ""Decent playmakers, bad sweepers."" Now, the cluster overall may be so, but some GKs in there might be on the upper end of the range in given metrics. They may be good playmakers and below average sweepers.

I won't lie, this part of the analysis was a lot of eye balling, but nonetheless, here are 3 other GK who are better open play playmakers than DDG, but not necesasrily better sweepers:

||Player|Squad|Age|Expected\_/90|Passes\_Launch%|Passes\_AvgLen|Goal Kicks\_Launch%|Goal Kicks\_AvgLen|Crosses\_Stp%|Sweeper\_#OPA|Sweeper\_AvgDist|Passes\_Att|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|55|Yehvann Diouf|Reims|24|0.29|29.7|32.3|32.9|33.8|9.3|1.13|12.7|27.3|
|101|Anthony Lopes|Lyon|33|0.08|32.2|32.4|31.1|32.4|5.5|0.58|12.7|24.6|
|84|Michele Di Gregorio|Monza|26|0.05|30.5|32.4|35.3|33.4|3.1|0.72|12.4|32.8|
|75|David de Gea|Manchester Utd|33|\-0.08|31.6|31.6|65.5|48.3|3|0.83|14.5|27.1|

computer vision,"The hitchhikers guide to computer vision Hey there,

It is not a tutorial or how-to-use-something post, but rather a set of links, tips, lifehacks. Covers data governance, mlops, tools, courses. I tried to make it practical and useful. Link to the origin: [The Hitchhiker's guide to computer vision](https://irregularadel.substack.com/p/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-computer-21-04-28?r=l7n3m&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=copy)

So, are you tired of this towardsdatascience/medium tutorials and posts about deep learning? Don‚Äôt panic. ¬© Take another one.

&amp;#x200B;

[I was thinking to add some DL meme at the beginning and my friend come up with this. Adel is me, by the way \( Õ°‚ùõ ·¥• Õ°‚ùõ\) ](https://preview.redd.it/jmhcpovghyv61.jpg?width=1076&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eedf09c31fc497682b4dffed470f60efbb4a1617)

Enjoy!

## Now, let‚Äôs start with the tools and infrastructure, for your CV research.

In general, several areas should be presented in your projects. There are a huge number of options in each area, and you can easily get lost. I believe that you should just choose one sample from each area and stick to it. These areas are:

* Starting from simple. **Language** ‚Äî without doubts, python. Others are way below. (Sorry R and [Matlab ](https://pics.me.me/pytorch-tensorflow-matlab-source-unknown-deep-learning-frameworks-war-52460350.png)users).
* **IDE** ‚Äî what IDE you will use? I personally use PyCharm, but know a lot of people who use VS Code. I know that there are Jupyter notebooks, google colabs. [Deepnote ](https://deepnote.com/)is quite a good tool as well. In fact, they all are nice, but not for proper R&amp;D nowadays. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love Jupyter notebook and use it a lot, but let‚Äôs be honest, it is not IDE, but rather a research prototyping environment. A combination of jupyter notebooks and proper IDE will boost your projects a lot.
* **Frameworks** ‚Äî today there are only two main players in this area: Pytorch and Tensorflow. There are hundreds of comparison articles, and both frameworks are great (some [fresh discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/k6n8m5/d_revisiting_the_tensorflow_vs_pytorch/) on Reddit). Again, just choose what you like the most and never regret it. My choice is Pytorch ‚Äî like it as hell. There also wrappers of these frameworks, I use[ Pytorch Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/) ‚Äî amazing stuff. There is a good [ecosystem around Pytroch](https://pytorch.org/ecosystem/) and sometimes I found something interesting and new there. Probably there is a similar thing for Tensorflow (sorry, too lazy to check)
* **Data management** ‚Äî very important and undeservedly ignored by the majority of people. There are amazing speeches of Andrej Karpathy about data importance, very inspiring ‚Äî highly recommend ([this](https://slideslive.com/38917690/multitask-learning-in-the-wilderness) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx7BXih7zx8) ‚Äî they are about a lot of things, tbh, but also about the importance of data). This is one of his slides that tells a lot. I use [DVC](https://dvc.org/) for data version control ‚Äî we also created a [data registry](https://dvc.org/doc/use-cases/data-registries) in our team. We keep track of all the changes in original raw data there (adding new data, reannotations, changes). Enjoying it a lot. Nice developing is happening in Activeloop: [Hub](https://github.com/activeloopai/Hub) is interesting solution and worth attention. Important thing: metadata is highly valuable as well. Never underestimate its importance. Data labeling could be a separate chapter, but I decided to put it here. Again, tons of image annotation tools on the market: choose the one that fits your need. We use [supervisely](https://supervise.ly/) at the moment, super convenient in distributed labeling. In general, be prepared to spend a lot of time on data: structuring, cleaning, labeling, visualizations, etc. ‚Äî all that is, in my opinion, way more important than actual straight ML/DL stuff. This is just something you should deal with. So keep calm, and spent time on data. More about data management is [here](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/spring2021/lecture-8/).

&amp;#x200B;

[ I a bit remade the image to make text more visible. ](https://preview.redd.it/byx7dmxjhyv61.png?width=1988&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d9391cd22b23f87d15dd5134d337dae1ce89557)

* **MLOps** ‚Äî something that everyone starts to talk about. To simplify: this is DevOps in the ML area. Probably, DVC can be related here as well. MLops is everything you will need to create a nice infrastructure for your ML projects. That includes experiments tracking, comparing, reproduction, models saving/tracking, CI/CD stuff that you can use. The market is full of free and paid packages. We use [MLFlow](https://mlflow.org/) and like it a lot. We have an MLFlow server with a minio backend, we store all our team experiments there. At the same time, we have [a Model registry](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/model-registry.html), that helps a lot in production. It gives us version control over the models and an easy way to load them. MLflow is not the only solution, of course. Take a look at others: [W &amp; B](https://wandb.ai/site), [comet](https://www.comet.ml/site/), [neptune](https://neptune.ai/). Also, nice free book: [Introducing MLOps](https://pages.dataiku.com/oreilly-introducing-mlops) from O‚ÄôReilly &amp; DataikuPlus some combination of this and previous bullet points: MLOps: From [Model-centric to Data-centric AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06-AZXmwHjo) lecture from Andrew Ng.

## Let‚Äôs go to the methods and algorithms.

CV is the most advanced field in DL (sorry NLP enthusiasts) and that causes the large variety of cool models/methods. On the other hand, each freaking day there is something new. Still, there are some classical constants that barely change. (in fact, if you are not into fundamental research, you can just choose some proven techniques and they will work. Well, most likely.)

* There are always some SOTA back-bone architectures, and they are quite constant. Resnets are a good baseline, se\_resnexts are usually way better. Efficient nets are also awesome. Unets are a solid choice for segmentation. FasterRCNN, yolos ‚Äî for detection. MaskRCNN for instance segmentation (but usually you want a separate classification part).
* A lot of nice Github repos on models mentioned above. Just google it, and find the one you like (or the one that fits in the current situation). For example, I enjoy this [pytorch segmentation repo](https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models.pytorch). Or this [efficient-net package](https://github.com/lukemelas/EfficientNet-PyTorch).
* Resources ‚Äî first of all, [ml in reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/). All cool stuff ends up being posted there anyway, so this is a must-read resource. Then, Twitter (sorry). I am subscribed to guys like mentioned earlier Andrej Karpathy. Find the ones you respect and believe in and follow them. You can also subscribe to official Pytorch/Tensorflow/You-name-it accounts, they announce and retweet a lot of cool stuff as well. Best courses I‚Äôve seen: from [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) (good DL for coders + SOTA algorithms discussed), [Full Stack Deep Learning](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/) ‚Äî just the best practical course I‚Äôve seen. [Basics of conv nets](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) from Stanford ‚Äî classic. Kaggle is the perfect way to follow on development of the best tricks and techniques (crazy augmentations like mix up, cutmix, tricky loss functions, multi-head networks etc.). The creativeness of sportsmen (and people there are real sportsmen imho) never stops to surprise me. Plus there are usually winning solution blog post, so keep an eye on them

Some words about GPUs

Miners blow the market and GPUs costs like spaceship now. But anyway, there are different options you can use, either you buy your own GPUs or borrow them in the cloud. It is relatively easy to come up with some AWS or Google cloud solutions. Also, in my experience, for most of the tasks, a few 10\*\*/20\*\* are already a solid choice at the beginning. Of course, that depends on the task and data, but most likely you can survive with smaller scales for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

[ But, boi, how satisfactory is it to work with big GPUs. ](https://preview.redd.it/22x8zmplhyv61.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b97920502a4f036490192e38e89d12c80d318b22)

Hope I didn‚Äôt forget anything important!

computer vision,"Is it worth to learn computer vision? Hello all!  
I am currently learning and trying to find some work in the field of web development.  
In the mean time, I was wondering if I could get into another field of computer science that's you know a bit interesting and one could do some great work.  
I have studied a bit what computer vision is and have worked on some pretty projects. But I am not sure if I should get into this field. Because I couldn't really find that many jobs for this field and most of them required pretty good university degrees!  


Do you people think I should continue studying in this field or should I look into another field?"
computer vision,"How is computer vision now? Haven't heard many updates about it. Although there were many scary stories about CV, some people like me who wishes to specialize in computational perception and robotics may need to attend the course. 

I looked at the omscentr and tried to search reviews on reddit, but it seems the reviews are actually really difficult to find. The latest review on the omcentral is from like May, which is like half a year ago..

Is it still horrific? Is the way of running the course still far from ideal? Let me know how CV is in recent terms."
computer vision,"[D] Has Computer Vision become oversaturated? Are there even any unsolved problems left? With things like Stable Diffusion, image processing pipelines on phones that incorporate SOTA super resolution, low-light enhancement, segmentation papers that one would only have dreamt of even a few years ago, and with research appearing increasingly incremental rather than definitive and new, it feels like the entire space of computer vision, image signal processing and computational photography has essentially got saturated, and at this point, the only thing that people care about is how to make their personal Anime character in Midjourney or how close the latest Samsung (or other Android brand's) flagship phone's photo- (and video-) graphy is to the latest iPhone.

Is it just me, or has the entire field saturated to the point that it's probably not worth even trying to do anything new and to probably just make incremental updates to things like Super Resolution, Low Light Enhancement, and Denoising algorithms for the rest of eternity?

I've been working on reimplementing the Real-ESRGAN paper, and it took me a huge amount of time, but I only ended up getting results subpar to it, and even then, the sheer amount of processing it requires is so daunting that it doesn't feel worth trying to train it on a completely new dataset...

Are there any unsolved problems left that are worth cracking, that would actually make people's lives easier in this field?"

computer vision,"Feeling hopeless about possible computer vision syndrome I work a lot on computers for my job (and in my free time) and started experiencing frequent eye strain (headaches, dry eyes, fatigue) about 1.5 years ago.

My original prescription was:

OS -5.75 -0.5 1.75 (SPH CYL AXIS)

OD -7.50 -0.5 1.75 (SPH CYL AXIS)

I talked to my ""primary"" optometrist, he lowered my prescription 0.5 diopters on an old pair of frames I had. I kept experiencing symptoms so we lowered them another 0.5 diopters (ending up at -4.75/-6.50).

Some of the traditional eye strain symptoms decreased, but I started having other symptoms like dizziness, nausea, and ""foggy-headedness"" instead. I saw an opthamologist, he said my eyes were fine and to talk to my optometrist again. I talked to my primary care physician, he said there was nothing else wrong with me.

I talked to a different optometrist who is a little more knowledgeable about eye strain. He prescribed me even weaker lenses (about a 1.25 diopters less from my original prescription) and added prism and astigmatism correction:

OD -4.50 -0.50 x10 1.5BI

OS -6.25 -0.75 x25 1.5BI

I've been wearing these lenses for a month or two now and I'm still getting the same symptoms, but to a slightly less severe degree.

It's pretty frustrating because I've tried making all sorts of changes to my work environment as well (e.g. lighting, posture, using eye drops, taking frequent breaks), but nothing seems to be getting rid of this problem for good. Am I just going to have to learn cope for the rest of my life?"

Gameplay:

https://reddit.com/link/z8qstu/video/596siu9n533a1/player

[For example: Closing a popup](https://i.redd.it/tdeex2b3333a1.gif)

# Why?

I've been playing strategy + city building + simulation? games like **TownsMen 6**, **Clash of the Clans**, and SimCity for the last 10 years.

On trying out **City Island 5** I found it mildly irritating that my collectables could not accumulate while I was outside the game. I might have had the best businesses, strategy, etc but I had to be in the game to ensure I collect the cash/keys/gold over time. For example, if my bakery makes ‚Ç¨100 per minute I would only earn ‚Ç¨100 after leaving the game and coming back 24 hours later.

This became especially tiresome while trying to accumulate ‚Ç¨5,000,000 required to buy the island shown below. This would take me roughly two weeks of gameplay if I don't spend any money - it's not worth it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This is a problem that can be solved using one of the greatest tools in my tool belt - programming.

I decided to create a Python bot used to play the game using computer vision and image processing techniques. The bot should be able to play the game without any human intervention.

Cuesti√≥n que tengo que hacer un laburito de detecci√≥n de fallas en un taller: quiero poner una c√°mara que le apunte a una mesa desde arriba (\~50 cm) y el flow que me gustar√≠a que tuviese es que la persona apoya la pieza sobre la mesa para revisarla, un modelo detecta presencia de objeto y le saca la foto, luego la persona la saca y pone otra, etc. Por una cuesti√≥n de espacio me gustar√≠a que la c√°mara est√© conectada a un servidorcito aparte, digamos habitaci√≥n contigua o en el piso de arriba.

La parte algor√≠tmica no es problema, pero s√≠ me importa de la c√°mara que:

1. En lo posible no cueste un huevo
2. Poder enviar la orden de disparar la foto en forma remota o algo as√≠ (desde el sv)
3. La resoluci√≥n deber√≠a ser decente para poder pasar las fotos por object detection despu√©s (no tengo idea cu√°nto, asumo m√≠nimo 8-10 MP)
4. Si se puede conectar por red en vez de wifi mejor, sino no importa

Y el problema es que no tengo la m√°s m√≠nima idea de c√°maras, no s√© ni marcas ni qu√© se usa. Un amigo me recomend√≥ mandarle una raspberry pi con el m√≥dulo de la c√°mara, pero lo veo medio rebuscado, siento que tiene que haber algo tipo lo que yo digo que no cueste una locura.

1) Muchas gracias por la ayuda a la gente que va comentando!

2) Ya hay un chab√≥n que mira medio r√°pido a ver si tiene fallitas la pieza (no me dejan hablar mucho de la naturaleza de la cuesti√≥n, digamos es de 20x10 cm), no son grandes las fallas (menos de 1 x 1, a veces menos de 0.5x0.5) pero suelen ser de diferente color y forma notoria. El problema es que est√° comprobado que tienen MUY baja eficacia y le quieren poner un detector en paralelo, de ah√≠ el tema de la c√°mara.

3) El rate es el del operario que va poniendo las cosas en la mesa y luego sacando, no los vi trabajando en vivo pero hay tiempo suficiente de que la c√°mara obture/haga foco y todo eso. La c√°mara no estar√≠a sacando m√°s de 1 foto por segundo ni en pedo, aunque tampoco estar√≠a bueno que tarde 1 seg en hacer foco."

The idea would be short sentences like ""street in ten meters"", ""tree straight ahead"".

**Pros:** 

* The code behind the software is pretty unique. 
* The Team: Ammar the tech lead worked on self-driving cars for 6 years after graduating from Cambridge University's Graduate program for Electrical Engineering and the computer vision + MENZYverse are both very interesting concepts. Humza is the Director of a Biometric Suite. Abdul is a programmer/data scientist. Zeeshan has been involved in crypto for some time.
* They're backed by some heavy-hitting Launchpads - Poolz, Seedify and Blokpad, have some decent advisors from Vincent Wu from Coinbase and Dan Glaser the Footballer (Soccer player) and are supposed to announce more this week.
* The current marketcap is abysmally low in terms of value (\~$16M) but they have potential to moon once their alpha product + NFTs launch later this month. 
* Low cost barrier to entry (NFT will be sub $100 for lifetime). Also, it doesn't degrade like Stepn so you don't have to repeat buy to keep getting paid to train. 
* Total Telegram users across all communities = 150K 
* Twitter - 50K (not sure of how many bots, probably need to ask Elon about that  [üòÇ](https://emojipedia.org/face-with-tears-of-joy/)), but they have pretty decent engagement.
* Team tokens are locked for a year.
* Can farm tokens through Tokenfarm as well. 
* The token will be able to mined (train2earned) more greatly in the initial period as it decreases with the amount of tokens sent out in an exponential pattern.

[Click here for GIF] (https://imgur.com/meuEfnI) of how the automation works.

&amp;nbsp;

# Introducing: the Blitz desktop app for League!

Hey /r/leagueoflegends! It‚Äôs Rick from Blitz. You might know us from our content, but for the last few months we‚Äôve also been working hard on an OP new desktop app for League. Think OP.GG + Champion.gg, combined and totally automated so all of your champion counters, runes, builds, and teammate stats are displayed and updated **in real-time** as you go through champion select and live game--no typing required.

I‚Äôm excited to announce that the app is now in **open beta** testing for Windows, and we‚Äôd love for you to check it out: [**blitz.gg/beta**](https://blitz.gg/beta).

&amp;nbsp;
******
&amp;nbsp;

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs cool about the Blitz app:

# It‚Äôs completely automated so you don‚Äôt have to do any work. No typing required.

[*[Gif of automation DURING CHAMP SELECT]*] (https://imgur.com/meuEfnI)

When you enter champion select, the Blitz app automatically enters live game mode and uses computer vision to pull your teammates‚Äô summoner names and instantly display their ranked stats, champion proficiency, and playstyles. As players lock in champions, the Blitz app detects those changes and updates their stats and counter recs as you go, without you lifting a finger.

# It gives build recommendations and win rates based on data from high-elo games BUT ALSO contextualizes them by matchup. 

[*[Screenshot here]*] (https://i.imgur.com/IinPzur.jpg)

Like other tools, the Blitz app recommends champion skill order, runes, and item builds based on highest winrate and most commonly built in high-elo ranked games (through our own analysis of game and player data pulled from Riot‚Äôs API - [more info here] (https://blitzesports.com/desktop/faq#blitzdata)). 

However, it also adjusts on-the-go based on your specific lane opponent. Your runes and early items should, for example, be very different if you‚Äôre laning against an AP poke champ as opposed to an AD assassin. Blitz takes these differences into account and shows the most successful builds **per matchup** (statistically) so you get a more effective build for your specific situation.

There‚Äôs also a handy button that instantly imports the recommended build to your League client so you don‚Äôt need to look up items in-game when every second counts.

# It includes champion-specific tips by high-elo players to help you counter your lane opponent.

[*[Screenshot here]*] (https://i.imgur.com/oIhksMG.jpg)

There are a lot of things that numbers can‚Äôt show, and one of these is a clear understanding of the playstyle, power spikes, and weaknesses of your lane opponent. We got high-elo players (big shoutout to u/Kayle_Bot and everyone who helped) to write up quick tips for countering each champion in lane--think of them as SparkNotes that you can skim while your game loads.

When you get in game, you can also check your opponents‚Äô ranked stats and playstyles, which the Blitz app automatically pulls and displays once their summoner names are available.

# Finally, it evaluates your performance after every game and breaks your play down into simple tags.

[*[Screenshot here]*] (https://i.imgur.com/z1k13Q4.jpg)

*You can also look [yourself up here on web. Here's Hashinshin's] (https://app.blitz.gg/lol/match/na1/hashinshin/2757275568)*

Sometimes you carry the game, sometimes you get carried, and sometimes you‚Äôre just plain unlucky. The Blitz app automatically pulls your performance data after every game and instantly compiles a personalized post-match report card with tags like:

* MVP
* Early Game Monster (high KP% early game)
* Unlucky :(
* Flame Horizon
* CS God
* THICC (tanked most dmg in the game)
* Got Camped

They‚Äôre fun to read and easy to apply, so you can start your next game knowing where you stand and what you need to do.

# And that‚Äôs about it! 

We‚Äôre very excited to finally bring the Blitz app out in the light of day, and we hope it proves useful for all of you!

Here‚Äôs the [**link to the app again**] (http://blitz.gg/beta). 

Remember, this is a beta so we need your feedback! You can send comments, feature requests, and bug reports directly to the Blitz team in our [Discord server] (http://blitz.gg/discord).

Happy to answer any questions about the app!

&amp;nbsp;

*Edit: Blitz currently works in all servers except Garena and CN. You can look up players and such in KR, but the summoner name detection won't work. "

computer vision,"Switch from Classic Computer vision to Deep Learning I develop classic Computer Vision algorithms on C++ and want to switch to Deep Learning area.  
For now, I see these options:  
**Plan #1:**

1. Join a small HW/mobile startup
2. Integrate/optimize neural networks (this usually requires C++)
3. Gradually move to NN finetuning.   
This may be possible if NN training and integration is made by the same team. That's why the company should be small.

**Plan #2:**

1. Learn leetcode
2. Apply to FAANG-like companies for SE in test role to support AI/scientific infrastructure
3. Try to switch from testing utils to NN finetuning. 

**Plan #3:**

1. Learn DL theory on excellent level
2. Join intern/junior position in bigtech
3. Hope to get a better offer for middle position from them

  
**My skills:**

* **C++**: 5 YoE as a main programming language
* **Python**: 2 YoE for auxiliary utils
* **DL**: 1 year of **commercial** experience, utilized a few networks as black boxes
* **DL theoty**: few online courses
* **Math**: good level
* **Extra**: 5 YoE in Classic Computer Vision

&amp;#x200B;

So, I have a couple of questions:

1. What do you think about these plans?
2. Maybe, you can share some relevant experience?
3. Do you have other ideas how to switch to DL with my experience?
4. Should I do pet projects to tell about them on job interview when the interviewer asks me about my DL experience?

I've worked at NASA for almost 30 years, long enough that I got to see the ISS get put in orbit. It's generally regarded as one of the best things we've ever done, and I agree. The amount of scientific data, discovery, disaster observation, it's just priceless. We'd all be living in a worse world without that hunk of metal orbiting our planet. It's a strange feeling to see everyone talking about taking it out of the sky. On one hand the thing is getting pretty old. It was built for 15 years of operation, but it's been functional for 21 now. On the other I'm, well, a little sentimental. Maybe all the talk of dismantling it is making me feel old.

Pretext first.

There are many things I'm not going to tell you about myself for obvious reasons, but I can tell you my experience with NASA. They're very open about things, inside the agency as well as outside. A lot of people like to think NASA is holding some serious secrets but that's just not true. Sometimes you can't walk 20FT without hearing a young excited scientist nerding out about some new discovery or theory to their colleagues. Management puts it how it is because in this line of work everyone needs to know and if anyone miscalculates it can mean disaster. All big scientific discoveries are put on paper within 24 hours and released to the public. You all get the picture. Point is, in 30 years of working here I've never encountered much dishonesty unless a politician walked in the door. I know everyone really well, and we get along just fine.

Recent events have changed everything. The excited chatter has mostly stopped, the US Government has people in suits crawling all over the place, and the higher ups obviously haven't gotten sleep since it was announced that the ISS was to be decommissioned. Despite all this we're to continue like it's business as usual, but every now and then one of us will get called up for an interview with the suits. Sometimes they'd be gone for a few minutes, sometimes they'd be gone for hours, but when they return to work we'd all ask what was going on. Every time we'd get the same answer. The suits would bring them into a room with a table, ask them some confusing un-contextual questions, then let them go.

It's not hard for us to connect the dots. Something happened in regards to the ISS. Most of us are closed off from upper management now, and those who can talk to them have that look in their eye. The look begging you not to talk to them, but they can't tell you not to. Everyone else is as confused as I am, and work has slowed to a crawl. Occasionally we'll get an exciting announcement that renews our wondrous exploratory child-brains, but for the most part it's become dreary.

A few days in I got pulled into a room with the suits. There were a lot of formalities to get through like my name, age, place of birth, etc. But then the questions started. Their demeanor changed on a dime as soon as the first word was spoken, and given what that question was I would have laughed if I hadn't been dragged into a room with government agents.

""What is your opinion on the color green?""

I didn't know how to respond at first, but eventually I said: ""I guess it's an ok color. I mean, it's not my favorite, but its nice.""

I remember feeling like I was back in elementary school with the entire class talking about what color was the best. It was awkward, and due to the situation quite jarring.

Bellow I've got the rest of the questions and my responses that I remember.

Agent: ""Do you have any aspirations besides working at NASA?""

Me: ""I've got a bucket list. Skydiving, seeing the world, that kind of thing.""

Agent: ""And do you believe you will come to complete that bucket list?""

Me: ""Well, yeah? Gotta retire at some point right?""

Agent: ""Good. Do you wish upon falling stars?""

Me: ""What? No that's... Ridiculous.""

&amp;#x200B;

Agent: ""If you did, is there anything you'd wish for?""

Me: ""Well, I dunno. Biological immortality?""

Agent: ""Do you hang posters in your room?""

Me: ""Not since I was a kid, no.""

Agent: ""What is one thing you consider objectively good?""

Me: ""Kittens?""

I said it in jest of course. Sometimes I try and break tension with a little comedy and it was out of my mouth before I knew what I was saying. Even so, I at least expected a slight smile before I was scolded, but the only thing the agent did was straighten his tie and repeat the question with a somehow even more serious look.

Me: ""Fine fine. Making sure those around you live their best lives... I suppose.""

Agent: ""You suppose?""

Me: ""No I... Figure of... No that doesn't apply. Listen this is awkward. I stick by what I said, final answer, can we move on?""

It was at this point I realized that when the agent had straightened his tie, it had changed from a formal back to a dark green. Either the agent had just pulled a magic trick with the smoothness of someone from Vegas, or I just hadn't realized it had been green the entire time. The brain has a tenancy to find patterns and lie to you, so in that moment I brushed it off, but the other two agents in the room still had black ties on.

Agent: ""Yes, we can. Tell me, what is sound?""

Me: ""Well, air waves. Specifically vibrations. Right now when you speak you are sending air particles crashing into each other, sending them to me, and my ears are picking it up.""

Agent: ""Do you mind if we take your temperature?""

Me: ""No. I had mine taken at the door but I guess you can here too.""

It was true. The agents had been taking everyone's temperature at the door these days. I didn't know why they'd need to do it a second time, but I wasn't about to argue. One of them walked over and used an unbranded digital temperature gun. After they had finished, the agent nodded to the others and I was escorted back to my floor and told to have a pleasant day. I was bombarded with questions from my colleagues, as was everyone else who got interviewed, but I didn't really have much of anything new to say.

After that day I started doing a bit of investigating. I had only been interviewed for a few minutes, so I started asking for specifics from those who had been taken for far longer. As far as the questions themselves go I had no luck. They were still ridiculous. Things like ""Have you tasted dogwater"" or ""Have you ever gone hiking?"". But there were some consistencies too. When I brought up the green tie they said they saw the same, but brushed it off for the same reasons I did. The temperature check? It happens at the end of every interview to everyone regardless of time. But for those who got interviewed for over an hour? There was another through-line. All of them were asked what the International Space Station was to them.

At this point I knew for absolute certain that something was being kept from us regarding the ISS. No more rumors, no more speculation, no more conspiracy theories. The agents were interested in our space station too. I had to get to the bottom of this, so I contacted the guys in charge of doing the math for weight on the next supply run to the ISS. Did I mention they're still sending things up there? Because they are. Apparently they were in a tough spot. Usually you know exactly what is going into space. You have to for literally hundreds of safety reasons. But the agents had been interfering since they appeared. They'd say that something new had been added to the list, tell them the weight and then inform them that they needed to update their math to include the mystery item. It was so against code that they'd tried to take it up to management several times, but every time management shot them down. I was told that one guy was considering quitting in protest due to how unsafe just randomly adding unknown things to a spacecraft was, but the next day someone else showed up in his position. The kid was friendly, excited, and under the impression the position had been left vacant for a while. He had no idea he'd just replaced someone. I tried to get into contact with the person who was fired, but no dice. The phone number must have been bad, and I didn't know him well enough to get in contact any other way. Decided given the situation it was a bad idea for me to do so anyways. Those agents kept giving me stares when I started asking for his number. But I'd been working there for 30 years, and I had my contacts.

Decided to hit up some of the old ISS crew members. I was buddy buddy with a few of them, even taking them out for drinks on occasion. I had been joking with a few of them not even a few months ago, and while our current predicament probably had nothing to do with them I had to be certain.

I went through every single number but they all went to voicemail. I know people sometimes change their numbers, but all of them? I branched out beyond the US. Wasn't too close to these guys, but I'd still shared a beer with a few of them. Still nothing. Not a peep. Nothing but the robotic voice telling me to leave a message after the tone. At this point I got anxious. Not a single ISS astronaut was answering the phone. I knew where a few of them lived and started compiling the addresses, but while searching them up I came across their pages. They all have google profiles of course, but now all of them had death dates. I sat there shocked as I saw my co-workers, friends, and associates all described as having died while in the woods, in gas explosions, car accidents, even a serial killer had gotten one of them.

I read into that one by the way. Someone had broken into their home. Family of four. I'll spare you the details but by the time police arrived it was to late for any of them. Allegedly the killer was high on several narcotics and died of overdose while being arrested. Several murders had been linked to him after the fact. I was shocked and heartbroken. No one had ever told me, and the way the guy went out was devastating. But then I looked at the date of the murder. I had to check my calendar, but there it was. I had taken the astronaut, his family, and several co-workers out to a movie not three days after the article said he died. It was to celebrate his full recovery after staying on the ISS so long. Things didn't line up, and while most of the death dates made sense some others didn't correlate with my calendar either. After I compiled all their addresses I took at look at the properties. All of them were closed down due to one thing or another. Gas leak had burned one down, one of them had left a stove on, a local forest fire had destroyed another, every single house was gone.

At this point I had to see it all with my own eyes. After work the next day I went on a half-hour drive to one of the closer residences. It had been a month or so but the property was owned by one of my closer buddies so it wouldn't be too strange to see me around the area. Sure enough the house was a smouldering ruin. Didn't even look like it had happened that long ago, maybe a day at most. There was even a firetruck still outside with firefighters sorting through it all. I was going to pull up and ask them what happened, but then I spotted the black van across the way. More government agents. I didn't want to be seen there, so I just drove by like anyone else would and didn't make eye contact. Could have been my paranoia, but I swore I could feel their gaze burning into the back of my skull.

Now I knew. Every single ISS crewmate was gone under mysterious circumstances. I think it's the government itself, but I don't understand why. I'd like to believe they aren't actually dead, just in a holding cell somewhere until this all blows over, but I just don't know. To make matters worse I was approached at work the next day. Agents of course. They didn't bring up any specifics, just said the same thing they'd been saying from day one. Don't interfere with their business and everything will be just fine. Then they left, and the day continued as per usual. Scared me half to death though. My mind was running through the possibility that they were going to make me disappear too, and it took every ounce of mental strength I had not to look like I was caught. Not even sure I did look normal that day to be honest. I had lost a lot of sleep and was living off of coffee.

As of now? Rumors about weapons being smuggled onto the ISS are circulating, no one is allowed to go to the upper floors now, and people are starting to get replaced faster and faster. One of my colleges who's been doing some investigating of his own said he looked at the ISS through his telescope and swears to God that it was spinning out of control and half covered in something black. Took a look myself, but I couldn't find the station at all. It's definitely not on it's projected orbital path. No one outside the agency is talking about this. For all the public knows NASA plans to decommission the ISS in 2031 and land it's remains on Point Nemo, which I will add is the furthest point from human civilization on the planet. They even denied letting museums keep pieces of it, opting to just get rid of the darn thing. I'm too afraid to go to the press about it too. I don't want to be replaced because I'm pretty sure everyone who does isn't just going back home unemployed. And those agents. They've asserted even more control. I pretty much directly report to them now, and they're the only ones who go upstairs. No one has seen anyone from upper management in weeks. To make matters worse I haven't even seen the agents express a hint of remorse, or any emotion really. It's just the stone cold stare 24/7. I'm starting to think they're robots. I'm also starting to think I'm going crazy, like I've been couped up in a cage for too long with eyes on me at every waking moment.

Does anyone have any idea what's going on? I need to get out of this before I end up in a cell, or worse. I think they know I'm looking into it, and I don't know what I'm going to do. My friends are gone along with half my colleagues. I just feel helpless.

international space station,"TIFU by sending a call from the International Space Station to voicemail This happened two days ago (Sunday). A friend of mine is currently on his second mission to the ISS. I saw a call come in on my iPhone and the caller ID said ‚ÄúUs Gov.‚Äù I first had that thought / feeling you get when the principal calls you to their office. ‚ÄúCrap. What did I do that I thought I got away with but maybe I didn‚Äôt?!‚Äù I was in the middle of something with a bunch of people and showed them what it said on my phone and everyone was all ""Don't answer it!"" Between everyone's suggestion and my gut feeling of being in trouble, I sent it to voicemail. Turns out it was my buddy calling from SPACE. I had a chance to speak to someone that wasn't on Earth and screwed it up. First thing he said in the voicemail was ‚ÄúYou probably saw a call from Us Gov and turned it down.‚Äù I know he‚Äôll call again, but damn I feel like an idiot right now.

TL;DR My buddy called me from the Iinternational Space Station and the caller ID said ‚ÄúUs Gov‚Äù so I sent it to voicemail and missed a call from space.

Edit: He called back tonight! What a fascinating and amazing call! I asked where he was flying over and he said the Western coast of Africa. I asked how the ride was and he said smooth and awesome. He said the second stage acceleration was incredible and that they hit over 4Gs, then at SECO they got thrown into their straps from the deceleration, and bam‚Ä¶orbit. Took roughly 8.5 min to get into orbit. They have a couple of days off (not because of Memorial Day). The conversation was 12 minutes long but we had to end it because of a satellite issue that was about to happens (exact reason is out of my wheelhouse). Ironically, I made him and I laser engraved rocks glasses and I was drinking out of it when he called. We also joked about some funny stuff that happened when I went out for the launch. He was cracking up about the situation with the first call that I shared here and said that‚Äôs a common occurrence :)"
